#APRICOT TUTORIAL

With this tutorial we will explore different modules of APRICOT and its basic usage.

###Required files:

1) Shell script `run_example.sh` that can be executed in a linux environment. [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT/blob/master/run_example.sh)

2) Please clone `git clone https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT.git` download the APRICOT repository.  [DOWNLOAD](http://malvikasharan.github.io/APRICOT/)

3) Please use the pypi link to update/install python packages.
`pip install bio-apricot`

4) Basic files required to run the APRICOT pipeline for tutorial/demonstration purpose. [DOWNLOAD]

####Not required

APRICOT requires local databases of Cdd and InterPro databases, along with the BLAST executables and InterProScan to carry out domain predictions. These requirements have been discussed in detail in the [documentation](https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT/blob/master/README.md). 

We will **NOT** install these for the tutorial. For the demonstration of the APRICOT pipeline, we have provided few required files on [zenodo].
