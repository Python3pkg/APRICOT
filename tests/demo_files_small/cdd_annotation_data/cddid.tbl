223796	COG0724	RRM	RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain [Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis]. 	306
211984	TIGR04261	rSAM_GlyRichRpt	radical SAM/SPASM domain protein, GRRM system. Members of this protein family are radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins (see pfam04055 and TIGR04085) related to anaeroboic sulfatase maturating enzymes and the peptide modification enzyme PqqE. Members are found primarily in Cyanobacteria adjacent to a short protein, ~150 residues, in which the last ~60 residues tends to be repetitive and highly glycine-rich (see TIGR04260). The arrangement suggests modifications to the repetitive C-terminal region by this radical SAM domain enzyme, but the purpose of this system on the whole is unknown.	363
275088	TIGR04262	orph_peri_GRRM	extracellular substrate-binding orphan protein, GRRM family. This subfamily belongs to bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 3 (pfam00497). In that family, most members are ABC transporter periplasmic substrate-binding proteins. However, members of the present subfamily are orphans in the sense of being adjacent to neither ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins or permease subunits. Instead, most members are encoded next to the two signature proteins of the proposed Glycine-Rich Repeat Modification (GRRM) system, a radical SAM/SPASM protein GrrM (TIGR04261) and the Gly-rich repeat protein itself GrrA (TIGR04260).	257
240668	cd00590	RRM_SF	RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily. RRM, also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), is a highly abundant domain in eukaryotes found in proteins involved in post-transcriptional gene expression processes including mRNA and rRNA processing, RNA export, and RNA stability. This domain is 90 amino acids in length and consists of a four-stranded beta-sheet packed against two alpha-helices. RRM usually interacts with ssRNA, but is also known to interact with ssDNA as well as proteins. RRM binds a variable number of nucleotides, ranging from two to eight. The active site includes three aromatic side-chains located within the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs of the domain. The RRM domain is found in a variety heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).	72
275447	cd01513	Translation_factor_III	Domain III of Elongation factor (EF) Tu (EF-TU), EF-G and related proteins. Elongation factors (EF) EF-Tu and EF-G participate in the elongation phase during protein biosynthesis on the ribosome. Their functional cycles depend on GTP binding and its hydrolysis. The EF-Tu complexed with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA delivers tRNA to the ribosome, whereas EF-G stimulates translocation, a process in which tRNA and mRNA movements occur in the ribosome. Experimental data showed that: (1) intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-G is influenced by excision of its domain III; (2) that EF-G lacking domain III has a 1,000-fold decreased GTPase activity on the ribosome and, a slightly decreased affinity for GTP; and (3) EF-G lacking domain III does not stimulate translocation, despite the physical presence of domain IV which is also very important for translocation. These findings indicate an essential contribution of domain III to activation of GTP hydrolysis. Domains III and V of EF-G have the same fold (although they are not completely superimposable), the double split beta-alpha-beta fold. This fold is observed in a large number of ribonucleotide binding proteins and is also referred to as the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or RNA recognition (RRM) motif. This domain III is found in several elongation factors, as well as in peptide chain release factors and in GT-1 family of GTPase (GTPBP1).	102
238902	cd01921	cyclophilin_RRM	cyclophilin_RRM: cyclophilin-type peptidylprolyl cis- trans isomerase domain occuring with a C-terminal RNA recognition motif domain (RRM). This subfamily of the cyclophilin domain family contains a number of eukaryotic cyclophilins having the RRM domain including the nuclear proteins: human hCyP-57, Arabidopsis thaliana AtCYP59, Caenorhabditis elegans CeCyP-44 and Paramecium tetrurelia Kin241. The Kin241 protein has been shown to have a role in cell morphogenesis.	166
100068	cd02639	R3H_RRM	R3H domain of mainly fungal proteins which are associated with a RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. Present in this group is the RNA-binding post-transcriptional regulator Cip2 (Csx1-interacting protein 2) involved in counteracting Csx1 function. Csx1 plays a central role in controlling gene expression during oxidative stress. The name of the R3H domain comes from the characteristic spacing of the most conserved arginine and histidine residues. The function of the domain is predicted to bind ssDNA or ssRNA in a sequence-specific manner.	60
153396	cd07323	LAM	LA motif RNA-binding domain. This domain is found at the N-terminus of La RNA-binding proteins as well as in other related proteins. Typically, the domain co-occurs with an RNA-recognition motif (RRM), and together these domains function to bind primary transcripts of RNA polymerase III in the La autoantigen (Lupus La protein, LARP3, or Sjoegren syndrome type B antigen, SS-B). A variety of La-related proteins (LARPs or La ribonucleoproteins), with differing domain architecture, appear to function as RNA-binding proteins in eukaryotic cellular processes.	75
153420	cd07920	Pumilio	Pumilio-family RNA binding domain. Puf repeats (also labelled PUM-HD or Pumilio homology domain) mediate sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio, worm FBF-1 and FBF-2, and many other proteins such as vertebrate Pumilio. These proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding to sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs, such as the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA. Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. Yeast PUF1 (JSN1), for instance, appears to contain a single RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain. Puf repeat proteins have been observed to function asymmetrically and may be responsible for creating protein gradients involved in the specification of cell fate and differentiation. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. This model encompasses all 8 tandem repeats. Some proteins may have fewer (canonical) repeats.	322
153397	cd08028	LARP_3	La RNA-binding domain of La-related protein 3. This domain is found at the N-terminus of the La autoantigen and similar proteins, and co-occurs with an RNA-recognition motif (RRM). Together these domains function to bind primary transcripts of RNA polymerase III at their 3' terminus and protect them from exonucleolytic degradation. Binding is specific for the 3'-terminal UUU-OH motif. The La autoantigen is also called Lupus La protein, LARP3, or Sjoegren syndrome type B antigen (SS-B).	82
153404	cd08035	LARP_4	La RNA-binding domain of La-related protein 4. This domain is found in vertebrate La-related protein 4 (LARP4), also known as c-MPL binding protein. La-type domains often co-occur with RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs). A variety of La-related proteins (LARPs or La ribonucleoproteins), with differing domain architecture, appear to function as RNA-binding proteins in eukaryotic cellular processes.	75
163687	cd08056	MPN_PRP8	Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domains without isopeptidase activity found in splicing factor Prp8. Members of this family are found in pre-mRNA-processing factor 8 (Prp8) which is a critical splicing factor, interacting with several other spliceosomal proteins, snRNAs, and the pre-mRNA, thus organizing and stabilizing the spliceosome catalytic core. Prp8 is one of the largest and most highly conserved of nuclear proteins, occupying a central  position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome. Its C-terminal domain exhibits a JAB1/MPN-like core similar to deubiquitinating enzymes, but does not show catalytic isopeptidase activity, possibly because the putative isopeptidase center is covered by insertions and terminal appendices that are grafted onto this core, thus impairing the metal binding site. It is proposed that this domain is a protein interaction domain instead of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme as proposed for some MPN proteins. The DEAD-box protein Brr2 and the GTPase Snu114 bind to the Prp8 C-terminus, a region where mutations in human Prp8 (hPrp8) cause a severe form of the genetic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, RP13, which leads to progressive photoreceptor degeneration in the retina and eventual blindness. At the N-terminus of Prp8, there are several domains, including a highly variable nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif rich in prolines, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), and U5 and U6 snRNA binding sites.	252

240669	cd12223	RRM_SR140	RNA recognition motif (RRM) in U2-associated protein SR140 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SR140 (also termed U2 snRNP-associated SURP motif-containing protein orU2SURP, or 140 kDa Ser/Arg-rich domain protein) which is a putative splicing factor mainly found in higher eukaryotes. Although it is initially identified as one of the 17S U2 snRNP-associated proteins, the molecular and physiological function of SR140 remains unclear. SR140 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a SWAP/SURP domain that is found in a number of pre-mRNA splicing factors in the middle region, and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain (RS domain).	84
240670	cd12224	RRM_RBM22	RNA recognition motif (RRM) found in Pre-mRNA-splicing factor RBM22 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of RBM22 (also known as RNA-binding motif protein 22, or Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 16), a newly discovered RNA-binding motif protein which belongs to the SLT11 gene family. SLT11 gene encoding protein (Slt11p) is a splicing factor in yeast, which is required for spliceosome assembly. Slt11p has two distinct biochemical properties: RNA-annealing and RNA-binding activities. RBM22 is the homolog of SLT11 in vertebrate. It has been reported to be involved in pre-splicesome assembly and to interact with the Ca2+-signaling protein ALG-2. It also plays an important role in embryogenesis. RBM22 contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a zinc finger of the unusual type C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H, and a C-terminus that is unusually rich in the amino acids Gly and Pro, including sequences of tetraprolines.	74
240671	cd12225	RRM1_2_CID8_like	RNA recognition motif 1 and 2 (RRM1, RRM2) in Arabidopsis thaliana CTC-interacting domain protein CID8, CID9, CID10, CID11, CID12, CID 13 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domains found in A. thaliana CID8, CID9, CID10, CID11, CID12, CID 13 and mainly their plant homologs. These highly related RNA-binding proteins contain an N-terminal PAM2 domain (PABP-interacting motif 2), two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a basic region that resembles a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The biological role of this family remains unclear.	77
240672	cd12226	RRM_NOL8	RNA recognition motif in nucleolar protein 8 (NOL8) and similar proteins. This model corresponds to the RRM of NOL8 (also termed Nop132) encoded by a novel NOL8 gene that is up-regulated in the majority of diffuse-type, but not intestinal-type, gastric cancers. Thus, NOL8 may be a good molecular target for treatment of diffuse-type gastric cancer. Also, NOL8 is a phosphorylated protein that contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), suggesting NOL8 is likely to function as a novel RNA-binding protein. It may be involved in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level or in ribosome biogenesis in cancer cells.	78
240673	cd12227	RRM_SCAF4_SCAF8	RNA recognition motif in SR-related and CTD-associated factor 4 (SCAF4), SR-related and CTD-associated factor 8 (SCAF8) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in a new class of SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors), including SCAF4, SCAF8 and similar proteins. The biological role of SCAF4 remains unclear, but it shows high sequence similarity to SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8). SCAF8 is a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. In addition, SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF8 and SCAF4 both contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.	77
240674	cd12228	RRM_ENOX	RNA recognition motif (RRM) in the cell surface Ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger (ECTO-NOX or ENOX) proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) in ECTO-NOX proteins (also termed ENOX), comprising a family of plant and animal NAD(P)H oxidases exhibiting both, oxidative and protein disulfide isomerase-like, activities. They are growth-related and drive cell enlargement, and may play roles in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. ENOX proteins function as terminal oxidases of plasma membrane electron transport (PMET) through catalyzing electron transport from plasma membrane quinones to extracellular oxygen, forming water as a product. They are also hydroquinone oxidases that oxidize externally supplied NADH, hence NOX. ENOX proteins harbor a di-copper center that lack flavin. ENOX proteins display protein disulfide interchange activity that is also possessed by protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast to the classic protein disulfide isomerases, ENOX proteins lack the double CXXC motif. This family includes two ENOX proteins, ENOX1 and ENOX2. ENOX1, also termed candidate growth-related and time keeping constitutive hydroquinone [NADH] oxidase (cCNOX), or cell proliferation-inducing gene 38 protein, or Constitutive Ecto-NOX (cNOX), is the constitutively expressed cell surface NADH (ubiquinone) oxidase that is ubiquitous and refractory to drugs. ENOX2, also termed APK1 antigen, or cytosolic ovarian carcinoma antigen 1, or tumor-associated hydroquinone oxidase (tNOX), is a cancer-specific variant of ENOX1 and plays a key role in cell proliferation and tumor progression. In contrast to ENOX1, ENOX2 is drug-responsive and harbors a drug binding site to which the cancer-specific S-peptide tagged pan-ENOX2 recombinant (scFv) is directed. Moreover, ENOX2 is specifically inhibited by a variety of quinone site inhibitors that have anticancer activity and is unique to the surface of cancer cells. ENOX proteins contain many functional motifs.	84
240675	cd12229	RRM_G3BP	RNA recognition motif (RRM) in ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein G3BP1, G3BP2 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain in the G3BP family of RNA-binding and SH3 domain-binding proteins. G3BP acts at the level of RNA metabolism in response to cell signaling, possibly as RNA transcript stabilizing factors or an RNase. Members include G3BP1, G3BP2 and similar proteins. These proteins associate directly with the SH3 domain of GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which functions as an inhibitor of Ras. They all contain an N-terminal nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an acidic domain, a domain containing PXXP motif(s), an RNA recognition motif (RRM), and an Arg-Gly-rich region (RGG-rich region, or arginine methylation motif).	81
240676	cd12230	RRM1_U2AF65	RNA recognition motif 1 found in U2 large nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65) and similar proteins. The subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of U2AF65 and dU2AF50. U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies. It associates with intronless mRNAs and plays a significant and unexpected role in the nuclear export of a large number of intronless mRNAs.	82

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Srp1p and RRM2 of plant SR splicing factors. Srp1p is encoded by gene srp1 from fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. It plays a role in the pre-mRNA splicing process, but is not essential for growth. Srp1p is closely related to the SR protein family found in Metazoa. It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a glycine hinge and a RS domain in the middle, and a C-terminal domain. The family also includes a novel group of arginine/serine (RS) or serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors existing in plants, such as A. thaliana RSp31, RSp35, RSp41 and similar proteins. Like vertebrate RS splicing factors, these proteins function as plant splicing factors and play crucial roles in constitutive and alternative splicing in plants. They all contain two RRMs at their N-terminus and an RS domain at their C-terminus.	70

240681	cd12235	RRM_PPIL4	RNA recognition motif in peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 4 (PPIase) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of PPIase, also termed cyclophilin-like protein PPIL4, or rotamase PPIL4, a novel nuclear RNA-binding protein encoded by cyclophilin-like PPIL4 gene.

240682	cd12236	RRM_snRNP70	RNA recognition motif in U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70 kDa (U1-70K) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of U1-70K, also termed snRNP70, a key component of the U1 snRNP complex, which is one of the key factors facilitating the splicing of pre-mRNA via interaction at the 5' splice site, and is involved in regulation of polyadenylation of some viral and cellular genes, enhancing or inhibiting efficient poly(A) site usage. U1-70K plays an essential role in targeting the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site through protein-protein interactions with regulatory RNA-binding splicing factors, such as the RS protein ASF/SF2. Moreover, U1-70K protein can specifically bind to stem-loop I of the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) contained in the U1 snRNP complex. It also mediates the binding of U1C, another U1-specific protein, to the U1 snRNP complex. U1-70K contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by an adjacent glycine-rich region at the N-terminal half, and two serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains at the C-terminal half. The RRM is responsible for the binding of stem-loop I of U1 snRNA molecule. Additionally, the most prominent immunodominant region that can be recognized by auto-antibodies from autoimmune patients may be located within the RRM. The SR domains are involved in protein-protein interaction with SR proteins that mediate 5' splice site recognition. For instance, the first SR domain is necessary and sufficient for ASF/SF2 Binding. The family also includes Drosophila U1-70K that is an essential splicing factor required for viability in flies, but its SR domain is dispensable. The yeast U1-70k doesn't contain easily recognizable SR domains and shows low sequence similarity in the RRM region with other U1-70k proteins and therefore not included in this family. The RRM domain is dispensable for yeast U1-70K function.	91

Both, MSSP-1 and -2, have been identified as protein factors binding to a putative DNA replication origin/transcriptional enhancer sequence present upstream from the human c-myc gene in both single- and double-stranded forms. Thus, they have been implied in regulating DNA replication, transcription, apoptosis induction, and cell-cycle movement, via the interaction with c-MYC, the product of protooncogene c-myc.

SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), which is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and it may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 contains two (some contain only one) RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily. However, the EK domain is unique to SREK1. It plays a modulatory role controlling SR domain function by involvement in the inhibition of both constitutive and alternative splicing and in the selection of splice-site. 	85

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of novel nuclear proteins termed ABT1 and its homologous counterpart, pre-rRNA-processing protein ESF2 (eighteen S factor 2), from yeast. ABT1 associates with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and enhances basal transcription activity of class II promoters. Meanwhile, ABT1 could be a transcription cofactor that can bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. The yeast ABT1 homolog, ESF2, is a component of 90S preribosomes and 5' ETS-based RNPs. It is previously identified as a putative partner of the TATA-element binding protein. However, it is primarily localized to the nucleolus and physically associates with pre-rRNA processing factors. ESF2 may play a role in ribosome biogenesis. It is required for normal pre-rRNA processing, as well as for SSU processome assembly and function. Both ABT1 and ESF2 contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	98

It has been suggested that AKAP-17A is an alternative splicing factor and an SR-related splicing protein that interacts with the classical SR protein ASF/SF2 and the SR-related factor ZNF265. Additional studies have indicated that AKAP-17A is a dual-specific protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) that can bind both type I and type II protein kinase A (PKA) with high affinity and co-localizes with the catalytic subunit of PKA in nuclear speckles as well as the splicing factor SC35 in splicing factor compartments. It is involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing possibly by docking a pool of PKA in splicing factor compartments.

Mei2-like proteins represent an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding protein family whose corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis.

This family also includes the yeast homolog of eIF-3 subunit B (eIF-3B, also termed PRT1 or eIF-3 p90) that interacts with the yeast homologs of eIF-3 subunits A(TIF32), G(TIF35), I(TIF34), J(HCR1), and E(Pci8). In yeast, eIF-3B (PRT1) contains an N-terminal RRM that is directly involved in the interaction with eIF-3A (TIF32) and eIF-3J (HCR1). In contrast to its human homolog, yeast eIF-3B (PRT1) may have potential to bind its total RNA through its RRM domain. 	84
240725	cd12279	RRM_TUT1	RNA recognition motif in speckle targeted PIP5K1A-regulated poly(A) polymerase (Star-PAP) and similar proteins.

The corresponding coding genes of these proteins are involved in deleterious genomic rearrangements with transcription factor genes in a variety of human sarcomas and acute leukemias. All FET proteins interact with each other and are therefore likely to be part of the very same protein complexes, which suggests a general bridging role for FET proteins coupling RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. The FET proteins contain multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif at the N-terminus. The C-terminal region consists of a conserved nuclear import and retention signal (C-NLS), a putative zinc-finger domain, and a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which is flanked by 3 arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) boxes. FUS and EWS might have similar sequence specificity; both bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. FUS has also been shown to bind strongly to human telomeric RNA and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1. To date, nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity of TAF15. 	81

240746	cd12300	RRM1_PAR14	RNA recognition motif 1 in vertebrate poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 14 (PARP-14). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of PARP-14, also termed aggressive lymphoma protein 2, a member of the B aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of macrodomain-containing PARPs. It is expressed in B lymphocytes and interacts with the IL-4-induced transcription factor Stat6. It plays a fundamental role in the regulation of IL-4-induced B-cell protection against apoptosis after irradiation or growth factor withdrawal. It mediates IL-4 effects on the levels of gene products that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and lymphomagenesis. PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional switch for Stat6-dependent gene activation. In the presence of IL-4, PARP-14 activates transcription by facilitating the binding of Stat6 to the promoter and release of HDACs from the promoter with an IL-4 signal. In contrast, in the absence of a signal, PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDACs. Moreover, the absence of PARP-14 protects against Myc-induced developmental block and lymphoma. Thus, PARP-14 may play an important role in Myc-induced oncogenesis. Research indicates that PARP-14 is also a binding partner with phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF). It can inhibit PGI/AMF ubiquitination, thus contributing to its stabilization and secretion. PARP-14 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), three tandem macro domains, and C-terminal region with sequence homology to PARP catalytic domain. 	82

PARP-10 is a novel oncoprotein c-Myc-interacting protein with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. It is localized to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In addition to PARP activity, PARP-10 is also involved in the control of cell proliferation by inhibiting c-Myc- and E1A-mediated cotransformation of primary cells. PARP-10 may also play a role in nuclear processes including the regulation of chromatin, gene transcription, and nuclear/cytoplasmic transport. PARP-10 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), two overlapping C-terminal domains composed of a glycine-rich region and a region with homology to catalytic domains of PARP enzymes (PARP domain). In addition, PARP-10 contains two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM). PARP-14, also termed aggressive lymphoma protein 2, is a member of the B aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of macrodomain-containing PARPs. Like PARP-10, PARP-14 also includes two RRMs at the N-terminus. Nmi, also termed N-myc and STAT interactor, is an interferon inducible protein that interacts with c-Myc, N-Myc, Max and c-Fos, and other transcription factors containing bHLH-ZIP, bHLH or ZIP domains. Besides binding Myc proteins, Nmi also associates with all the Stat family of transcription factors except Stat2. In response to cytokine (e.g. IL-2 and IFN-gamma) stimulation, Nmi can enhance Stat-mediated transcriptional activity through recruiting the Stat1 and Stat5 transcriptional coactivators, CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. IFP 35 is an interferon-induced leucine zipper protein that can specifically form homodimers. Distinct from known bZIP proteins, IFP 35 lacks a basic domain critical for DNA binding. In addition, IFP 35 may negatively regulate other bZIP transcription factors by protein-protein interaction. For instance, it can form heterodimers with B-ATF, a member of the AP1 transcription factor family. Both Nmi and IFP35 harbor one RRM. RBM43 is a putative RNA-binding protein containing one RRM, but its biological function remains unclear. 	74

It is essential for the H3 lysine-4 methylation. in vivo, and plays an important role in telomere maintenance and DNA repair in an ATM kinase Rad3-dependent pathway. spSet1p is the homology counterpart of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1p (scSet1p). However, it is more closely related to Set1 found in mammalian. Moreover, unlike scSet1p, spSet1p is not required for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast. spSet1p contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a conserved SET domain that may play a role in DNA repair and telomere function. 	86
240750	cd12304	RRM_Set1	RNA recognition motif in the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases which includes Set1A and Set1B that are ubiquitously expressed vertebrates histone methyltransferases exhibiting high homology to yeast Set1. Set1A and Set1B proteins exhibit a largely non-overlapping subnuclear distribution in euchromatic nuclear speckles, strongly suggesting that they bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. With the exception of the catalytic component, the subunit composition of the Set1A and Set1B histone methyltransferase complexes are identical. Each complex contains six human homologs of the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex, including Set1A or Set1B, Ash2 (homologous to yeast Bre2), CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1; homologous to yeast Spp1), Rbbp5 (homologous to yeast Swd1), Wdr5 (homologous to yeast Swd3), and Wdr82 (homologous to yeast Swd2). The genomic targeting of these complexes is determined by the identity of the catalytic subunit present in each histone methyltransferase complex. Thus, the Set1A and Set1B complexes may exhibit both overlapping and non-redundant properties. Both Set1A and Set1B contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), an N- SET domain, and a C-terminal catalytic SET domain followed by a post-SET domain. In contrast to Set1B, Set1A additionally contains an HCF-1 binding motif that interacts with HCF-1 in vivo. 	93

NELF is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of NELF A, B, C or the splice variant D, and E. NELF-E contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). It plays a role in the control of HIV transcription by binding to TAR RNA. In addition, NELF-E is associated with the NELF-B subunit, probably via a leucine zipper motif. 	75

PABPs are highly conserved proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3' ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs. They have been implicated in the regulation of poly(A) tail length during the polyadenylation reaction, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization by influencing the rate of deadenylation and inhibition of mRNA decapping. ePABP-2 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and PABP-2 is located in the nucleus. In contrast to the type I PABPs containing four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), the type II PABPs contains a single highly-conserved RRM. This subfamily also includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae RBP29 (SGN1, YIR001C) gene encoding cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein Rbp29 that binds preferentially to poly(A). Although not essential for cell viability, Rbp29 plays a role in modulating the expression of cytoplasmic mRNA. Like other type II PABPs, Rbp29 contains one RRM only. 	73

The RS domain modulates SRSF2 activity through phosphorylation, directly contacts RNA, and promotes protein-protein interactions with the spliceosome. SRSF8, also termed SRP46 or SFRS2B, is a novel mammalian SR splicing factor encoded by a PR264/SC35 functional retropseudogene. SRSF8 is localized in the nucleus and does not display the same activity as PR264/SC35.

It is a serine-arginine (SR) protein that acts as a potent and general splicing repressor when dephosphorylated. It mediates global inhibition of splicing both in M phase of the cell cycle and in response to heat shock. SRSF10 emerges as a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) splicing efficiency. It also regulates cardiac-specific alternative splicing of triadin pre-mRNA and is required for proper Ca2+ handling during embryonic heart development. In contrast, the phosphorylated SRSF10 functions as a sequence-specific splicing activator in the presence of a nuclear cofactor. It activates distal alternative 5' splice site of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo. Moreover, SRSF10 strengthens pre-mRNA recognition by U1 and U2 snRNPs.

The first subgroup consists of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 4 (SRSF4 or SRp75 or SFRS4), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5 or SRp40 or SFRS5 or HRS) and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 (SRSF6 or SRp55). The second subgroup is composed of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1 or ASF-1), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 9 (SRSF9 or SRp30C) and plant pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF2 (SR1). These SR proteins are mainly involved in regulating constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. They also have been implicated in transcription, genomic stability, mRNA export and translation. All SR proteins in this family, except SRSF5, undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting their widespread roles in gene expression. These SR proteins share a common domain architecture comprising two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), followed by a C-terminal RS domains rich in serine-arginine dipeptides. Both domains can directly contact with RNA. The RRMs appear to determine the binding specificity and the SR domain also mediates protein-protein interactions. In addition, this subfamily includes the yeast nucleolar protein 3 (Npl3p), also termed mitochondrial targeting suppressor 1 protein, or nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 1. It is a major yeast RNA-binding protein that competes with 3'-end processing factors, such as Rna15, for binding to the nascent RNA, protecting the transcript from premature termination and coordinating transcription termination and the packaging of the fully processed transcript for export. It specifically recognizes a class of G/U-rich RNAs. Npl3p is a multi-domain protein with two RRMs, separated by a short linker and a C-terminal domain rich in glycine, arginine and serine residues. 	71

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in the hnRNP C-related protein family, including hnRNP C proteins, Raly, and Raly-like protein (RALYL). hnRNP C proteins, C1 and C2, are produced by a single coding sequence. They are the major constituents of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex in vertebrates. They bind hnRNA tightly, suggesting a central role in the formation of the ubiquitous hnRNP complex; they are involved in the packaging of the hnRNA in the nucleus and in processing of pre-mRNA such as splicing and 3'-end formation. Raly, also termed autoantigen p542, is an RNA-binding protein that may play a critical role in embryonic development. The biological role of RALYL remains unclear. It shows high sequence homology with hnRNP C proteins and Raly. Members of this family are characterized by an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal auxiliary domain. The Raly proteins contain a glycine/serine-rich stretch within the C-terminal regions, which is absent in the hnRNP C proteins. Thus, the Raly proteins represent a newly identified class of evolutionarily conserved autoepitopes. 	68

CoAA contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a TRBP-interacting domain. RBM4 is a ubiquitously expressed splicing factor with two isoforms, RBM4A (also known as Lark homolog) and RBM4B (also known as RBM30), which are very similar in structure and sequence. RBM4 may also function as a translational regulator of stress-associated mRNAs as well as play a role in micro-RNA-mediated gene regulation. RBM4 contains two N-terminal RRMs, a CCHC-type zinc finger, and three alanine-rich regions within their C-terminal regions. This family also includes Drosophila RNA-binding protein lark (Dlark), a homolog of human RBM4. It plays an important role in embryonic development and in the circadian regulation of adult eclosion. Dlark shares high sequence similarity with RBM4 at the N-terminal region. However, Dlark has three proline-rich segments instead of three alanine-rich segments within the C-terminal region. 	66

Moreover, Cyp33 interacts with the third plant homeodomain (PHD3) zinc finger cassette of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proto-oncoprotein and a poly-A RNA sequence through its RRM domain. It further mediates downregulation of the expression of MLL target genes HOXC8, HOXA9, CDKN1B, and C-MYC, in a proline isomerase-dependent manner. Cyp33 also possesses a PPIase activity that catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding a proline, which has been implicated in the stimulation of folding and conformational changes in folded and unfolded proteins.

PGC-1beta plays a nonredundant role in controlling mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism and affects both, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis, and functions in a number of oxidative tissues. It is involved in maintaining baseline mitochondrial function and cardiac contractile function following pressure overload hypertrophy by preserving glucose metabolism and preventing oxidative stress. PGC-1beta induces hypertriglyceridemia in response to dietary fats through activating hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion. It can stimulate apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) expression, further mediating hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid. PGC-1beta also drives nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) target gene expression and NRF-1 and estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha)-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis.

NTC is composed of the scaffold protein Prp19 and a number of associated splicing factors, and plays a crucial role in intron removal during premature mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Cwc2 functions as an RNA-binding protein that can bind both small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and pre-mRNA in vitro. It interacts directly with the U6 snRNA to link the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing. In the N-terminal half, Cwc2 contains a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF domain), a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and an intervening loop, also termed RNA-binding loop or RB loop, between ZnF and RRM, all of which are necessary and sufficient for RNA binding.

The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also known as BRUNOL-2, CUG-BP1, NAPOR, EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also known as BRUNOL-3, ETR-3, CUG-BP2, NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also known as BRUNOL-1, TNRC4, ETR-1, CAGH4, ER DA4), CELF-4 (BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (BRUNOL-5) and CELF-6 (BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both, sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts.

Based on both sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts. 	73

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two mammalian homologs of Drosophila transformer-2 (Tra2), TRA2-alpha, TRA2-beta (also termed SFRS10), and similar proteins found in eukaryotes. TRA2-alpha is a 40-kDa serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein that specifically binds to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) exonic splicing enhancer on exon 4 (ESE4) and is necessary for enhanced GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. It strongly stimulates GnRH intron A excision in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TRA2-alpha can interact with either 9G8 or SRp30c, which may also be crucial for ESE-dependent GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. TRA2-beta is a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein that controls the pre-mRNA alternative splicing of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) protein and the tau protein. Both, TRA2-alpha and TRA2-beta, contains a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), flanked by the N- and C-terminal arginine/serine (RS)-rich regions. 	78

The RD motif is responsible for the acidic pH-dependent DNA-binding properties of RDM1. It interacts with ss- and dsDNA, and may act as a DNA-damage recognition factor by recognizing the distortions of the double helix caused by cisplatin-DNA adducts in vitro. In addition, due to the presence of RRM, RDM1 can bind to RNA as well as DNA. 	81

Furthermore, RNPS1 is a splicing regulator whose activator function is controlled in part by CK2 (casein kinase II) protein kinase phosphorylation. It can also function as a squamous-cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells-3 (SART3)-binding protein, and is involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing. RNPS1 contains an N-terminal serine-rich (S) domain, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and the C-terminal arginine/serine/proline-rich (RS/P) domain. 	73

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two serine/arginine (SR) proteins, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (SRSF7). SRSF3, also termed pre-mRNA-splicing factor SRp20, modulates alternative splicing by interacting with RNA cis-elements in a concentration- and cell differentiation-dependent manner. It is also involved in termination of transcription, alternative RNA polyadenylation, RNA export, and protein translation. SRSF3 is critical for cell proliferation, and tumor induction and maintenance. It can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. SRSF7, also termed splicing factor 9G8, plays a crucial role in both constitutive splicing and alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs. Its localization and functions are tightly regulated by phosphorylation. SRSF7 is predominantly present in the nuclear and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. It cooperates with the export protein, Tap/NXF1, helps mRNA export to the cytoplasm, and enhances the expression of unspliced mRNA. Moreover, SRSF7 inhibits tau E10 inclusion through directly interacting with the proximal downstream intron of E10, a clustering region for frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP) mutations. Both SRSF3 and SRSF7 contain a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides.

The Hu proteins family represents a group of RNA-binding proteins involved in diverse biological processes. Since the Hu proteins share high homology with the Drosophila embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) protein, the Hu family is sometimes referred to as the ELAV family. Drosophila ELAV is exclusively expressed in neurons and is required for the correct differentiation and survival of neurons in flies. The neuronal members of the Hu family include Hu-antigen B (HuB or ELAV-2 or Hel-N1), Hu-antigen C (HuC or ELAV-3 or PLE21), and Hu-antigen D (HuD or ELAV-4), which play important roles in neuronal differentiation, plasticity and memory. HuB is also expressed in gonads. Hu-antigen R (HuR or ELAV-1 or HuA) is ubiquitously expressed Hu family member. It has a variety of biological functions mostly related to the regulation of cellular response to DNA damage and other types of stress. Hu proteins perform their cytoplasmic and nuclear molecular functions by coordinately regulating functionally related mRNAs. In the cytoplasm, Hu proteins recognize and bind to AU-rich RNA elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain target mRNAs, such as GAP-43, vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), the glucose transporter GLUT1, eotaxin and c-fos, and stabilize those ARE-containing mRNAs. They also bind and regulate the translation of some target mRNAs, such as neurofilament M, GLUT1, and p27. In the nucleus, Hu proteins function as regulators of polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Each Hu protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). RRM1 and RRM2 may cooperate in binding to an ARE. RRM3 may help to maintain the stability of the RNA-protein complex, and might also bind to poly(A) tails or be involved in protein-protein interactions. This family also includes the sex-lethal protein (SXL) from Drosophila melanogaster. SXL governs sexual differentiation and X chromosome dosage compensation in flies. It induces female-specific alternative splicing of the transformer (tra) pre-mRNA by binding to the tra uridine-rich polypyrimidine tract at the non-sex-specific 3' splice site during the sex-determination process. SXL binds to its own pre-mRNA and promotes female-specific alternative splicing. It contains an N-terminal Gly/Asn-rich domain that may be responsible for the protein-protein interaction, and tandem RRMs that show high preference to bind single-stranded, uridine-rich target RNA transcripts. 	77

However, it binds to poly(A) with a lower affinity than PABP-1. PABP-1 possesses an A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR and allows binding of PABP and blockage of translation of its own mRNA. In contrast, PABP-3 lacks the A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR. PABP-4 is an inducible poly(A)-binding protein (iPABP) that is primarily localized to the cytoplasm. It shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1 as well. The RNA binding properties of PABP-1 and PABP-4 appear to be identical. PABP-5 is encoded by PABPC5 gene within the X-specific subinterval, and expressed in fetal brain and in a range of adult tissues in mammalian, such as ovary and testis. It may play an important role in germ cell development. Moreover, unlike other PABPs, PABP-5 contains only four RRMs, but lacks both the linker region and the CTD. PABP-1-like and PABP-1-like 2 are the orthologs of PABP-1. PABP-4-like is the ortholog of PABP-5. Their cellular functions remain unclear. The family also includes the yeast PABP, a conserved poly(A) binding protein containing poly(A) tails that can be attached to the 3'-ends of mRNAs. The yeast PABP and its homologs may play important roles in the initiation of translation and in mRNA decay. Like vertebrate PABP-1, the yeast PABP contains four RRMs, a linker region, and a proline-rich CTD as well. The first two RRMs are mainly responsible for specific binding to poly(A). The proline-rich region may be involved in protein-protein interactions. 	80

PABP-1 is an ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that may play a role in 3' end formation of mRNA, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization, protection of poly(A) from nuclease activity, mRNA deadenylation, inhibition of mRNA decapping, and mRNP maturation. Although PABP-1 is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, it is also found in the nucleus. PABP-1 may be involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and utilization of mRNP particles. PABP-1 contains four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), a less well conserved linker region, and a proline-rich C-terminal conserved domain (CTD). PABP-3 is a testis-specific poly(A)-binding protein specifically expressed in round spermatids. It is mainly found in mammalian and may play an important role in the testis-specific regulation of mRNA homeostasis. PABP-3 shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1.

240828	cd12382	RRM_RBMX_like	RNA recognition motif in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (hnRNP G), Y chromosome RNA recognition motif 1 (hRBMY), testis-specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G-T (hnRNP G-T) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of hnRNP G, also termed glycoprotein p43 or RBMX, an RNA-binding motif protein located on the X chromosome. It is expressed ubiquitously and has been implicated in the splicing control of several pre-mRNAs. Moreover, hnRNP G may function as a regulator of transcription for SREBP-1c and GnRH1. Research has shown that hnRNP G may also act as a tumor-suppressor since it upregulates the Txnip gene and promotes the fidelity of DNA end-joining activity. In addition, hnRNP G appears to play a critical role in proper neural development of zebrafish and frog embryos. The family also includes several paralogs of hnRNP G, such as hRBMY and hnRNP G-T (also termed RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked-like-2). Both, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T, are exclusively expressed in testis and critical for male fertility. Like hnRNP G, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T interact with factors implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, such as hTra2-beta1 and T-STAR. Although members in this family share a high conserved N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), they appear to recognize different RNA targets. For instance, hRBMY interacts specifically with a stem-loop structure in which the loop is formed by the sequence CA/UCAA. In contrast, hnRNP G associates with single stranded RNA sequences containing a CCA/C motif. In addition to the RRM, hnRNP G contains a nascent transcripts targeting domain (NTD) in the middle region and a novel auxiliary RNA-binding domain (RBD) in its C-terminal region. The C-terminal RBD exhibits distinct RNA binding specificity, and would play a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing by hnRNP G. 	80

It also directly binds the 3' untranslated region of p21 mRNA that is one of the target mRNAs for hnRNP K. Both, hnRNP K and RBM42, are components of stress granules (SGs). Under nonstress conditions, RBM42 predominantly localizes within the nucleus and co-localizes with hnRNP K. Under stress conditions, hnRNP K and RBM42 form cytoplasmic foci where the SG marker TIAR localizes, and may play a role in the maintenance of cellular ATP level by protecting their target mRNAs. RBM42 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	83

Both, RBM24 and RBM38, are preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. They regulate myogenic differentiation by controlling the cell cycle in a p21-dependent or -independent manner. RBM24, also termed RNA-binding region-containing protein 6, interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of myogenin mRNA and regulates its stability in C2C12 cells. RBM38, also termed CLL-associated antigen KW-5, or HSRNASEB, or RNA-binding region-containing protein 1(RNPC1), or ssDNA-binding protein SEB4, is a direct target of the p53 family. It is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 mRNA by binding to their 3'-UTRs. It also binds the AU-/U-rich elements in p63 3'-UTR and regulates p63 mRNA stability and activity. SUP-12 is a novel tissue-specific splicing factor that controls muscle-specific splicing of the ADF/cofilin pre-mRNA in C. elegans. All family members contain a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	76

Moreover, hnRNP M is able to interact with early spliceosomes, further influencing splicing patterns of specific pre-mRNAs. hnRNP M functions as the receptor of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) that contains the penta-peptide sequence PELPK signaling motif. In addition, hnRNP M and another splicing factor Nova-1 work together as dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) pre-mRNA-binding proteins. They regulate alternative splicing of D2R pre-mRNA in an antagonistic manner. hnRNP M contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and an unusual hexapeptide-repeat region rich in methionine and arginine residues (MR repeat motif). MEF-2 is a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that binds specifically to ssDNA derived from the proximal (MB1) element of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter and represses transcription of the MBP gene.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization.

It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. The family also includes yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. RNA15 is a core subunit of cleavage factor IA (CFIA), an essential transcriptional 3'-end processing factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of eIF-4B, a multi-domain RNA-binding protein that has been primarily implicated in promoting the binding of 40S ribosomal subunits to mRNA during translation initiation. It contains two RNA-binding domains; the N-terminal well-conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), binds the 18S rRNA of the 40S ribosomal subunit and the C-terminal basic domain (BD), including two arginine-rich motifs (ARMs), binds mRNA during initiation, and is primarily responsible for the stimulation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A. eIF-4B also contains a DRYG domain (a region rich in Asp, Arg, Tyr, and Gly amino acids) in the middle, which is responsible for both, self-association of eIF-4B and  binding to the p170 subunit of eIF3. Additional research indicates that eIF-4B can interact with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in mammalian cells, which can stimulate both, the eIF-4B-mediated activation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A and binding of poly(A) by PABP. eIF-4B has also been shown to interact specifically with the internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) of several picornaviruses which facilitate cap-independent translation initiation. 	77

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of several tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms of vertebrate RNA binding protein Fox-1 homologs, which show high sequence similarity to the Caenorhabditis elegans feminizing locus on X (Fox-1) gene encoding Fox-1 protein. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 1 (RBFOX1), also termed ataxin-2-binding protein 1 (A2BP1), or Fox-1 homolog A, or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 1 (HRNBP1), is predominantly expressed in neurons, skeletal muscle and heart. It regulates alternative splicing of tissue-specific exons by binding to UGCAUG elements. Moreover, RBFOX1 binds to the C-terminus of ataxin-2 and forms an ataxin-2/A2BP1 complex involved in RNA processing. RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2), also termed Fox-1 homolog B, or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2 (HRNBP2), or RNA-binding motif protein 9 (RBM9), or repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity, is expressed in ovary, whole embryo, and human embryonic cell lines in addition to neurons and muscle. RBFOX2 activates splicing of neuron-specific exons through binding to downstream UGCAUG elements. RBFOX2 also functions as a repressor of tamoxifen activation of the estrogen receptor. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 3 (RBFOX3 or NeuN or HRNBP3), also termed Fox-1 homolog C, is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of the RBFOX2 pre-mRNA, producing a message encoding a dominant negative form of the RBFOX2 protein. Its message is detected exclusively in post-mitotic regions of embryonic brain. Like RBFOX1, both RBFOX2 and RBFOX3 bind to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG elements and modulate brain and muscle-specific splicing of exon EIIIB of fibronectin, exon N1 of c-src, and calcitonin/CGRP. Members in this family also harbor one RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). 	76

This family also includes yeast eIF3-p33, a homolog of vertebrate eIF-3G, plays an important role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in yeast.

Gene IST3 encoding ist3, also termed U2 snRNP protein SNU17 (Snu17p), is a novel yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein required for the first catalytic step of splicing and for progression of spliceosome assembly. It binds specifically to the U2 snRNP and is an intrinsic component of prespliceosomes and spliceosomes. Yeast ist3 contains an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). In the yeast pre-mRNA retention and splicing complex, the atypical RRM of ist3 functions as a scaffold that organizes the other two constituents, Bud13p (bud site selection 13) and Pml1p (pre-mRNA leakage 1). Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene cwf29 encoding ist3, also termed cell cycle control protein cwf29, is an RNA-binding protein complexed with cdc5 protein 29. It also contains one RRM. The biological function of RBMX2 remains unclear. It shows high sequence similarity to yeast ist3 protein and harbors one RRM as well. 	89

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of two Deleted in AZoospermia (DAZ) autosomal homologs, DAZL (DAZ-like) and BOULE. BOULE is the founder member of the family and DAZL arose from BOULE in an ancestor of vertebrates. The DAZ gene subsequently originated from a duplication transposition of the DAZL gene. Invertebrates contain a single DAZ homolog, BOULE, while vertebrates, other than catarrhine primates, possess both BOULE and DAZL genes. The catarrhine primates possess BOULE, DAZL, and DAZ genes. The family members encode closely related RNA-binding proteins that are required for fertility in numerous organisms. These proteins contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a varying number of copies of a DAZ motif, believed to mediate protein-protein interactions. DAZL and BOULE contain a single copy of the DAZ motif, while DAZ proteins can contain 8-24 copies of this repeat. Although their specific biochemical functions remain to be investigated, DAZL proteins may interact with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), and act as translational activators of specific mRNAs during gametogenesis.  	80

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of the SAFB family, including scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), scaffold attachment factor B2 (SAFB2), SAFB-like transcriptional modulator (SLTM), and similar proteins, which are ubiquitously expressed. SAFB1, SAFB2 and SLTM have been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis.

SAFB1 is a nuclear protein with a distribution similar to that of SLTM, but unlike that of SAFB2, which is also found in the cytoplasm. To a large extent, SAFB1 and SLTM might share similar functions, such as the inhibition of an oestrogen reporter gene. The additional cytoplasmic localization of SAFB2 implies that it could play additional roles in the cytoplasmic compartment which are distinct from the nuclear functions shared with SAFB1 and SLTM. 	74
240864	cd12418	RRM_Aly_REF_like	RNA recognition motif in the Aly/REF family. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of  Aly/REF family which includes THO complex subunit 4 (THOC4, also termed Aly/REF), S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (SKAR, also termed PDIP3 or PDIP46) and similar proteins. THOC4 is an mRNA transporter protein with a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). It is involved in RNA transportation from the nucleus, and was initially identified as a transcription coactivator of LEF-1 and AML-1 for the TCRalpha enhancer function. In addition, THOC4 specifically binds to rhesus (RH) promoter in erythroid, and might be a novel transcription cofactor for erythroid-specific genes. SKAR shows high sequence homology with THOC4 and possesses one RRM as well. SKAR is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus. It may be a critical player in the function of S6K1 in cell and organism growth control by binding the activated, hyperphosphorylated form of S6K1 but not S6K2. Furthermore, SKAR functions as a protein partner of the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In addition, SKAR may have particular importance in pancreatic beta cell size determination and insulin secretion. 	75

PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. Rod1 is a mammalian polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs.

It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. The family also includes polypyrimidine tract binding protein homolog 3 (PTBPH3) found in plant. Although its biological roles remain unclear, PTBPH3 shows significant sequence similarity to other family members, all of which contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

Although its biological roles remain unclear, PTBPH3 shows significant sequence similarity to polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) that is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. Like PTB, PTBPH3 contains four RRMs.	71
240871	cd12425	RRM4_PTBP1_like	RNA recognition motif 4 in polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM4 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. All members in this family contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	76

PARN belongs to the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases. It contains a nuclease domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and an R3H domain. PARN exists as a homodimer. The nuclease domain is involved in the dimerization. RRM and R3H domains are essential for the RNA-binding. 	65

It may play a role in promoting translation by stabilizing mRNA. LARP5 is a cytosolic protein that co-sediments with polysomes and accumulates upon stress induction in cellular stress granules. It can interact with the cytosolic poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPC1) and the receptor for activated C Kinase (RACK1), a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. LARP5 may function as a stimulatory factor of translation through bridging mRNA factors of the 3' end with initiating ribosomes. Both, LARP4 and LARP5, are structurally related to the La autoantigen. Like other La-related proteins (LARPs) family members, LARP4 and LARP5 contain a La motif (LAM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	76

The GW182 family proteins directly interact with Argonaute (Ago) proteins, and thus function as downstream effectors in the miRNA pathway, responsible for inhibition of translation and acceleration of mRNA decay. Members in this family are characterized by an abnormally high content of glycine/tryptophan (G/W) repeats, one or more glutamine (Q)-rich motifs, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The only exception is the worm protein that does not contain a recognizable RRM domain. The GW182 family proteins are recruited to miRNA targets through an interaction between their N-terminal domain and an Argonaute protein.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two active phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatases, synaptojanin-1 and synaptojanin-2. They have different interaction partners and are likely to have different biological functions. Synaptojanin-1 was originally identified as one of the major Grb2-binding proteins that may participate in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. It also acts as a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding brain-specific inositol 5-phosphatase with a putative role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Both, synaptojanin-1 and synaptojanin-2, have two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, a shorter isoform expressed in brain and a longer isoform in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-1 contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the cytoplasmic portion of the yeast protein Sac1p, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich region mediating the binding of synaptojanin-1 to various SH3 domain-containing proteins including amphiphysin, SH3p4, SH3p8, SH3p13, and Grb2. Synaptojanin-2 shows high sequence homology to the N-terminal Sac1p homology domain, the central inositol 5-phosphatase domain, the putative RNA recognition motif (RRM) of synaptojanin-1, but differs in the proline-rich region. 	78

It tightly associates with the nuclear envelope membrane and the nuclear lamina where it interacts with lamin B. It may also interact with a group of nucleoporins including Nup93, Nup155, and Nup205 and play a role in the association of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad1 with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The family also includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup53p, an ortholog of vertebrate nucleoporin Nup53. A unique property of yeast Nup53p is that it contains an additional Kap121p-binding domain and interacts specifically with the karyopherin Kap121p, which is involved in the assembly of Nup53p into NPCs. Both, vertebrate Nup35 and yeast Nup53p, contain an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix and several FG repeats. This family corresponds to the RRM domain which lacks the conserved residues that typically bind RNA in canonical RRM domains.	73

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of the CPEB family of proteins that bind to defined groups of mRNAs and act as either translational repressors or activators to regulate their translation. CPEB proteins are well conserved in both, vertebrates and invertebrates. Based on sequence similarity, RNA-binding specificity, and functional regulation of translation, the CPEB proteins have been classified into two subfamilies. The first subfamily includes CPEB-1 and related proteins. CPEB-1 is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), a short U-rich motif in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain mRNAs. It functions as a translational regulator that plays a major role in the control of maternal CPE-containing mRNA in oocytes, as well as of subsynaptic CPE-containing mRNA in neurons. Once phosphorylated and recruiting the polyadenylation complex, CPEB-1 may function as a translational activator stimulating polyadenylation and translation. Otherwise, it may function as a translational inhibitor when dephosphorylated and bind to a protein such as maskin or neuroguidin, which blocks translation initiation through interfering with the assembly of eIF-4E and eIF-4G. Although CPEB-1 is mainly located in cytoplasm, it can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. The second subfamily includes CPEB-2, CPEB-3, CPEB-4, and related protiens. Due to high sequence similarity, members in this subfamily may share similar expression patterns and functions. CPEB-2 is an RNA-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in testis and localized in cytoplasm in transfected HeLa cells. It preferentially binds to poly(U) RNA oligomers and may regulate the translation of stored mRNAs during spermiogenesis. CPEB-2 impedes target RNA translation at elongation; it directly interacts with the elongation factor, eEF2, to reduce eEF2/ribosome-activated GTP hydrolysis in vitro and inhibit peptide elongation of CPEB2-bound RNA in vivo. CPEB-3 is a sequence-specific translational regulatory protein that regulates translation in a polyadenylation-independent manner. It functions as a translational repressor that governs the synthesis of the AMPA receptor GluR2 through binding GluR2 mRNA. It also represses translation of a reporter RNA in transfected neurons and stimulates translation in response to NMDA. CPEB-4 is an RNA-binding protein that mediates meiotic mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation. It is essential for neuron survival and present on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is accumulated in the nucleus upon ischemia or the depletion of ER calcium. CPEB-4 is overexpressed in a large variety of tumors and is associated with many mRNAs in cancer cells. All CPEB proteins are nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling proteins. They contain an N-terminal unstructured region, followed by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a Zn-finger motif.

240892	cd12446	RRM_RBM25	RNA recognition motif in eukaryotic RNA-binding protein 25 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM25, also termed Arg/Glu/Asp-rich protein of 120 kDa (RED120), or protein S164, or RNA-binding region-containing protein 7, an evolutionary-conserved splicing coactivator SRm160 (SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa, )-interacting protein. RBM25 belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins containing a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), at the N-terminus, a RE/RD-rich (ER) central region, and a C-terminal proline-tryptophan-isoleucine (PWI) motif. It localizes to the nuclear speckles and associates with multiple splicing components, including splicing cofactors SRm160/300, U snRNAs, assembled splicing complexes, and spliced mRNAs. It may play an important role in pre-mRNA processing by coupling splicing with mRNA 3'-end formation. Additional research indicates that RBM25 is one of the RNA-binding regulators that direct the alternative splicing of apoptotic factors. It can activate proapoptotic Bcl-xS 5'ss by binding to the exonic splicing enhancer, CGGGCA, and stabilize the pre-mRNA-U1 snRNP through interaction with hLuc7A, a U1 snRNP-associated factor. 	84

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of two structurally related heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, CIRBP (also termed CIRP or A18 hnRNP) and RBM3 (also termed RNPL), both of which belong to a highly conserved cold shock proteins family. The cold shock proteins can be induced after exposure to a moderate cold-shock and other cellular stresses such as UV radiation and hypoxia. CIRBP and RBM3 may function in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to different transcripts, thus allowing the cell to response rapidly to environmental signals. However, the kinetics and degree of cold induction are different between CIRBP and RBM3. Tissue distribution of their expression is different. CIRBP and RBM3 may be differentially regulated under physiological and stress conditions and may play distinct roles in cold responses of cells. CIRBP, also termed glycine-rich RNA-binding protein CIRP, is localized in the nucleus and mediates the cold-induced suppression of cell cycle progression. CIRBP also binds DNA and possibly serves as a chaperone that assists in the folding/unfolding, assembly/disassembly and transport of various proteins. RBM3 may enhance global protein synthesis and the formation of active polysomes while reducing the levels of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing microRNAs. RBM3 may also serve to prevent the loss of muscle mass by its ability to decrease cell death. Furthermore, RBM3 may be essential for cell proliferation and mitosis. Both, CIRBP and RBM3, contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), that is involved in RNA binding, and C-terminal glycine-rich domain (RGG motif) that probably enhances RNA-binding via protein-protein and/or protein-RNA interactions. Like CIRBP, RBM3 can also bind to both RNA and DNA via its RRM domain. 	80

RIM4 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The family also includes a putative RNA-binding protein termed multicopy suppressor of sporulation protein Msa1. It is a putative RNA-binding protein encoded by a novel gene, msa1, from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Msa1 may be involved in the inhibition of sexual differentiation by controlling the expression of Ste11-regulated genes, possibly through the pheromone-signaling pathway.

240901	cd12455	RRM_like_Smg4_UPF3	RNA recognition motif-like Smg4_UPF3 domain in yeast up-frameshift suppressor 3 (Upf3p), Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4, their human orthologs Upf3A and Upf3B, and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM-like Smg4_UPF3 domain found in yeast up-frameshift suppressor 3 (Upf3p), Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4, their human orthologs Upf3A and Upf3B, and similar proteins. Upf3p, also termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay protein 3, or Sua6p, a surveillance factor encoded by UPF3 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in yeast. Upf3p is primarily cytoplasmic but accumulates inside the nucleus. Its nuclear import is mediated by the Srp1p (importin-alpha)/beta heterodimer while its nuclear export is mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES-A), but not the Crm1p exportin. C. elegans SMG-4 is a nuclear shuttling protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus through nuclear import and export signals similar to that of the yeast Upf3p. It is regulated by phosphorylation. Human orthologs of yeast Upf3p and C. elegans SMG-4 include Upf3A and Upf3B, which derive from two genes, UPF3A and X-linked UPF3B, respectively. Both, Upf3A (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog A, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3A, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3A) and Upf3B (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog B on chromosome X, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3B, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3B), are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. They associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any human Upf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA prevents NMD. The function of the Upf proteins in identifying and targeting nonsense mRNAs for rapid decay is conserved among eukaryotes. Besides, all Upf proteins in this family contain a conserved Smg4_UPF3 domain with some similarity to an RNA recognition motif (RRM), indicating that they may be RNA binding proteins. 	88

Although its biological function remains unclear, SCAF4 shows high sequence similarity to SCAF8 that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF4 and SCAF8 both contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.	81

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8), a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of G3BP1, also termed ATP-dependent DNA helicase VIII (DH VIII), or GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1, which has been identified as a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease that interacts with the SH3 domain of RasGAP, a multi-functional protein controlling Ras activity. The acidic RasGAP binding domain of G3BP1 harbors an arsenite-regulated phosphorylation site and dominantly inhibits stress granule (SG) formation. G3BP1 also contains an N-terminal nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM domain), and an Arg-Gly-rich region (RGG-rich region, or arginine methylation motif). The RRM domain and RGG-rich region are canonically associated with RNA binding. G3BP1 co-immunoprecipitates with mRNAs. It binds to and cleaves the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the c-myc mRNA in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thus, G3BP1 may play a role in coupling extra-cellular stimuli to mRNA stability. It has been shown that G3BP1 is a novel Dishevelled-associated protein that is methylated upon Wnt3a stimulation and that arginine methylation of G3BP1 regulates both Ctnnb1 mRNA and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Furthermore, G3BP1 can be associated with the 3'-UTR of beta-F1 mRNA in cytoplasmic RNA-granules, demonstrating that G3BP1 may specifically repress the translation of the transcript.	80

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of G3BP2, also termed GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 2, a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with both IkappaBalpha and IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB complexes, indicating that G3BP2 may play a role in the control of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of IkappaBalpha and cytoplasmic anchoring of the IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB complex. G3BP2 contains an N-terminal nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an acidic domain, a domain containing five PXXP motifs, an RNA recognition motif (RRM domain), and an Arg-Gly-rich region (RGG-rich region, or arginine methylation motif). It binds to the SH3 domain of RasGAP, a multi-functional protein controlling Ras activity, through its N-terminal NTF2-like domain. The acidic domain is sufficient for the interaction of G3BP2 with the IkappaBalpha cytoplasmic retention sequence. Furthermore, G3BP2 might influence stability or translational efficiency of particular mRNAs by binding to RNA-containing structures within the cytoplasm through its RNA-binding domain.	83
240911	cd12465	RRM_UHMK1	RNA recognition motif found in U2AF homology motif kinase 1 (UHMK1) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of UHMK1. UHMK1, also termed kinase interacting with stathmin (KIS) or P-CIP2, is a serine/threonine protein kinase functionally related to RNA metabolism and neurite outgrowth. It contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), with high homology to the corresponding motif of the mammalian U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65 or U2AF2). UHMK1 targets two key regulators of cell proliferation and migration, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 and the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin. It plays a critical role during vascular wound repair by preventing excessive vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration into the vascular lesion. Moreover, UHMK1 may control cell migration and neurite outgrowth by interacting with and phosphorylating the splicing factor SF1, thereby probably contributing to the control of protein expression. Furthermore, UHMK1 may be functionally related to microtubule dynamics and axon development. It localizes to RNA granules, interacts with three proteins found in RNA granules (KIF3A, NonO, and eEF1A), and further enhances the local translation. UHMK1 is highly expressed in regions of the brain implicated in schizophrenia and may play a role in susceptibility to schizophrenia.	88

It is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. SRSF11 has been identified as a tau exon 10 splicing repressor. It interacts with a purine-rich element in exon 10, and suppresses exon 10 inclusion by antagonizing Tra2beta, an SR-domain-containing protein that enhances exon 10 inclusion. SRSF11 is a unique SR family member and may regulate the alternative splicing in a tissue- and substrate-dependent manner. It can directly interact with the U2 auxiliary factor 65-kDa subunit (U2AF65), a protein associated with the 3' splice site. In addition, unlike the typical SR proteins, SRSF11 associates with other SR proteins but not with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1-70K or the U2 auxiliary factor 35-kDa subunit (U2AF35). SREK1 has unique properties in regulating alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs; it promotes the use of the distal 5' splice site in E1A pre-mRNA alternative splicing.

It is a unique SR family member and may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 generally contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily. However, the EK domain is unique to SREK1; plays a modulatory role controlling SR domain function by involvement in the inhibition of both constitutive and alternative splicing and in the selection of splice-site. 	80

It is a multi-functional protein and has been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, chromosome stability, cell spreading, and transcription. FUS was originally identified in human myxoid and round cell liposarcomas as an oncogenic fusion with the stress-induced DNA-binding transcription factor CHOP (CCAAT enhancer-binding homologous protein) and later as hnRNP P2, a component of hnRNP H complex assembled on pre-mRNA. It can form ternary complexes with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2. Additional research indicates that FUS binds preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. In the presence of Mg2+, it can bind both single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) and promote ATP-independent annealing of complementary ssDNA and D-loop formation in superhelical dsDNA. FUS has been shown to be recruited by single stranded noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, where it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation. TAF15 (TAFII68), also termed TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N (TAF2N), or RNA-binding protein 56 (RBP56), originally identified as a TAF in the general transcription initiation TFIID complex, is a novel RNA/ssDNA-binding protein with homology to the proto-oncoproteins FUS and EWS (also termed EWSR1), belonging to the FET family as well.

It plays a fundamental role in the regulation of IL-4-induced B-cell protection against apoptosis after irradiation or growth factor withdrawal. It mediates IL-4 effects on the levels of gene products that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and lymphomagenesis. PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional switch for Stat6-dependent gene activation. In the presence of IL-4, PARP-14 activates transcription by facilitating the binding of Stat6 to the promoter and release of HDACs from the promoter with an IL-4 signal. In contrast, in the absence of a signal, PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDACs. Absence of PARP-14 protects against Myc-induced developmental block and lymphoma. Thus, PARP-14 may play an important role in Myc-induced oncogenesis. Additional research indicates that PARP-14 is also a binding partner with phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF). It can inhibit PGI/AMF ubiquitination, thus contributing to its stabilization and secretion. PARP-14 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), three tandem macro domains, and C-terminal region with sequence homology to PARP catalytic domain. 	74

CELF-1 (also termed BRUNOL-2, or CUG-BP1, or EDEN-BP) and CELF-2 (also termed BRUNOL-3, or ETR-3, or CUG-BP2, or NAPOR) belong to the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) family of RNA-binding proteins that have been implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and control of mRNA translation and deadenylation. CELF-1 is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. The human CELF-1 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing, with implications for onset of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), a neuromuscular disease associated with an unstable CUG triplet expansion in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene; it preferentially targets UGU-rich mRNA elements. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It binds specifically to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity; it binds preferentially to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. It also binds to the 3'-UTR of cyclooxygenase-2 messages, affecting both translation and mRNA stability, and binds to apoB mRNA, regulating its C to U editing. CELF-2 also contains three highly conserved RRMs. It binds to RNA via the first two RRMs, which are also important for localization in the cytoplasm. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-2 on some specific substrates is mediated by RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-2, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. In addition, CELF-2 possesses a typical arginine and lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus, within RRM3.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of PUF60, also termed FUSE-binding protein-interacting repressor (FBP-interacting repressor or FIR), or Ro-binding protein 1 (RoBP1), or Siah-binding protein 1 (Siah-BP1), an essential splicing factor that functions as a poly-U RNA-binding protein required to reconstitute splicing in depleted nuclear extracts.

HuR also has pro-apoptotic function by promoting apoptosis when cell death is unavoidable. Furthermore, HuR may be important in muscle differentiation, adipogenesis, suppression of inflammatory response and modulation of gene expression in response to chronic ethanol exposure and amino acid starvation. Hu proteins perform their cytoplasmic and nuclear molecular functions by coordinately regulating functionally related mRNAs.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. 	75

Invertebrates contain a single BOULE, while vertebrates, other than catarrhine primates, possess both BOULE and DAZL genes. The catarrhine primates possess BOULE, DAZL, and DAZ genes. BOULE encodes an RNA-binding protein containing an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a single copy of the DAZ motif. Although its specific biochemical functions remains to be investigated, BOULE protein may interact with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), and act as translational activators of specific mRNAs during gametogenesis. 	81

241120	cd12676	RRM3_Nop4p	RNA recognition motif 3 in yeast nucleolar protein 4 (Nop4p) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of Nop4p (also known as Nop77p), encoded by YPL043W from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is an essential nucleolar protein involved in processing and maturation of 27S pre-rRNA and biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunits.

241122	cd12678	RRM_SLTM	RNA recognition motif in Scaffold attachment factor (SAF)-like transcription modulator (SLTM) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of SLTM, also termed modulator of estrogen-induced transcription, which shares high sequence similarity with scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1). It contains a scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain) DNA-binding motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region rich in glutamine and arginine residues. To a large extent, SLTM co-localizes with SAFB1 in the nucleus, which suggests that they share similar functions, such as the inhibition of an oestrogen reporter gene. However, rather than mediating a specific inhibitory effect on oestrogen action, SLTM is shown to exert a generalized inhibitory effect on gene expression associated with induction of apoptosis in a wide range of cell lines. 	74
241123	cd12679	RRM_SAFB1_SAFB2	RNA recognition motif in scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), scaffold attachment factor B2 (SAFB2), and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to RRM of SAFB1, also termed scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B), heat-shock protein 27 estrogen response element ERE and TATA-box-binding protein (HET), or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP A1- associated protein (HAP), a large multi-domain protein with well-described functions in transcriptional repression, RNA splicing and metabolism, and a proposed role in chromatin organization. Based on the numerous functions, SAFB1 has been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis. SAFB1 specifically binds to AT-rich scaffold or matrix attachment region DNA elements (S/MAR DNA) by using its N-terminal scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain), a homeodomain-like DNA binding motif. The central region of SAFB1 is composed of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminus of SAFB1 contains Glu/Arg- and Gly-rich regions that might be involved in protein-protein interaction. Additional studies indicate that the C-terminal region contains a potent and transferable transcriptional repression domain. Another family member is SAFB2, a homolog of SAFB1. Both SAFB1 and SAFB2 are ubiquitously coexpressed and share very high sequence similarity, suggesting that they might function in a similar manner. However, unlike SAFB1, exclusively existing in the nucleus, SAFB2 is also present in the cytoplasm. The additional cytoplasmic localization of SAFB2 implies that it could play additional roles in the cytoplasmic compartment which are distinct from the nuclear functions shared with SAFB1.	76

It is involved in RNA transportation from the nucleus. THOC4 was initially identified as a transcription coactivator of LEF-1 and AML-1 for the TCRalpha enhancer function. In addition, THOC4 specifically binds to rhesus (RH) promoter in erythroid. It might be a novel transcription cofactor for erythroid-specific genes. 	75

SKAR is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus. It may be a critical player in the function of S6K1 in cell and organism growth control by binding the activated, hyperphosphorylated form of S6K1 but not S6K2. Furthermore, SKAR functions as a protein partner of the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In addition, SKAR may have particular importance in pancreatic beta cell size determination and insulin secretion. SKAR contains a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	69
241126	cd12682	RRM_RBPMS	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBP-MS).

It contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). RBP-MS physically interacts with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 and plays a role in regulation of Smad-mediated transcriptional activity. In addition, RBP-MS may be involved in regulation of mRNA translation and localization during Xenopus laevis development. 	76

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and functions at several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein and negatively regulates the onset of differentiation.

Synaptojanin-1 has two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, synaptojanin-145 expressed in brain and synaptojanin-170 expressed in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-145 is very abundant in nerve terminals and may play an essential role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. In contrast to synaptojanin-145, synaptojanin-170 contains three unique asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motifs in the C-terminal region and may functions as a potential binding partner for Eps15, a clathrin coat-associated protein acting as a major substrate for the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor. 	77

It functions as a translational regulator that plays a major role in the control of maternal CPE-containing mRNA in oocytes, as well as of subsynaptic CPE-containing mRNA in neurons. Once phosphorylated and recruiting the polyadenylation complex, CPEB-1 may function as a translational activator stimulating polyadenylation and translation. Otherwise, it may function as a translational inhibitor when dephosphorylated and bound to a protein such as maskin or neuroguidin, which blocks translation initiation through interfering with the assembly of eIF-4E and eIF-4G. Although CPEB-1 is mainly located in cytoplasm, it can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of hnRNP H (also termed mcs94-1), hnRNP H2 (also termed FTP-3 or hnRNP H') and hnRNP F, which represent a group of nuclear RNA binding proteins that play important roles in the regulation of alternative splicing decisions. hnRNP H and hnRNP F are two closely related proteins, both of which bind to the RNA sequence DGGGD. They are present in a complex with the tissue-specific splicing factor Fox2, and regulate the alternative splicing of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) transcripts. The presence of Fox 2 can allows hnRNP H and hnRNP F to better compete with the SR protein ASF/SF2 for binding to FGFR2 exon IIIc. Thus, hnRNP H and hnRNP F can function as potent silencers of FGFR2 exon IIIc inclusion through an interaction with the exonic GGG motifs. Furthermore, hnRNP H and hnRNP H2 are almost identical; bothe have been found to bind nuclear-matrix proteins. hnRNP H activates exon inclusion by binding G-rich intronic elements downstream of the 5' splice site in the transcripts of c-src, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Bcl-X, GRIN1, and myelin. It silences exons when bound to exonic elements in the transcripts of beta-tropomyosin, HIV-1, and alpha-tropomyosin. hnRNP H2 has been implicated in pre-mRNA 3' end formation.

Members in this family can regulate the alternative splicing of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) transcripts, and function as silencers of FGFR2 exon IIIc through an interaction with the exonic GGG motifs. The lack of RRM1 could account for the reduced silencing activity within hnRNP H3. In addition, like other hnRNP H protein family members, hnRNP H3 has an extensive glycine-rich region near the C-terminus, which may allow it to homo- or heterodimerize. 	75

They localize to nucleoli, suggesting roles in ribosomal RNA production, but RH-II/Gubeta also localizes to nuclear speckles containing the splicing factor SC35, suggesting its possible involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In contrast to RH-II/Gualpha, RH-II/Gubeta has RNA-unwinding activity, but no RNA-folding activity. The family also contains plant DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 7 (RH7 or PRH75), Thermus thermophilus heat resistant RNA-dependent ATPase (Hera) and similar proteins.

D. melanogaster NONA is involved in eye development and behavior and may play a role in circadian rhythm maintenance, similar to vertebrate p54nrb.

Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for paraspeckle localization to subnuclear bodies.	94
240583	cd12948	NOPS_PSF	NOPS domain, including C-terminal coiled-coil region, in polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-associated-splicing factor (PSF) and similar proteins. This model contains the NOPS (NONA and PSP1) domain PSF (also termed proline- and glutamine-rich splicing factor, or 100 kDa DNA-pairing protein (POMp100), or 100 kDa subunit of DNA-binding p52/p100 complex), with a long helical C-terminal extension. PSF is a multifunctional protein that mediates diverse activities in the cell. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in vertebrates. PSF binds not only RNA but also single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as well as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and facilitates the renaturation of complementary ssDNAs. Additionally, it promotes the formation of D-loops in superhelical duplex DNA, and is involved in cell proliferation. PSF can also interact with multiple factors. It is an RNA-binding component of spliceosomes and binds to insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE). Moreover, PSF functions as a transcriptional repressor interacting with Sin3A and mediating silencing through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of nuclear hormone receptors. As an RNA-binding component of spliceosomes, PSF binds to the insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE), and acts as an independent negative regulator of the transcriptional activity of the porcine P-450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme gene (P450scc) IGFRE. PSF is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor and is dissociated from PTB and binds to U1-70K and serine-arginine (SR) proteins during apoptosis. In addition, PSF forms a heterodimer with the nuclear protein p54nrb, also known as non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO). The PSF/p54nrb complex displays a variety of functions, such as DNA recombination and RNA synthesis, processing, and transport. PSF contains two conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), which are responsible for interactions with RNA and for the localization of the protein in speckles. It also contains an N-terminal region rich in proline, glycine, and glutamine residues, which may play a role in interactions recruiting other molecules. The NOPS domain specifically binds to the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) domain of the partner DBHS protein via a substantial interaction surface. Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for localization of these proteins to subnuclear bodies.	97
240584	cd12949	NOPS_PSPC1	NOPS domain, including C-terminal coiled-coil region, in paraspeckle protein component 1 (PSPC1) and similar proteins. The family contains a DBHS domain (for Drosophila behavior, human splicing), which comprises two conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a charged protein-protein interaction NOPS (NONA and PSP1) domain. This model corresponds to the NOPS domain, with a long helical C-terminal extension, of paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1, also termed PSP1), a novel nucleolar factor that accumulates within a new nucleoplasmic compartment, termed paraspeckles, and diffusely distributes in the nucleoplasm. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in vertebrates. Although its cellular function remains unknown currently, PSPC1 forms a novel heterodimer with the nuclear protein p54nrb, also known as non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), which localizes to paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent manner. The NOPS domain specifically binds to the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) domain of the partner DBHS protein via a substantial interaction surface. Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for localization of these proteins to subnuclear bodies.	94
240577	cd12950	RRP7_Rrp7p	RRP7 domain ribosomal RNA-processing protein 7 (Rrp7p) and similar proteins. This CD corresponds to the RRP7 domain of Rrp7p. Rrp7p is encoded by YCL031C gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is an essential yeast protein involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. Rrp7p contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal RRP7 domain.	128
240578	cd12951	RRP7_Rrp7A	RRP7 domain ribosomal RNA-processing protein 7 homolog A (Rrp7A) and similar proteins. The family corresponds to the RRP7 domain of Rrp7A, also termed gastric cancer antigen Zg14, and similar proteins which are yeast ribosomal RNA-processing protein 7 (Rrp7p) homologs mainly found in Metazoans. The cellular function of Rrp7A remains unclear currently. Rrp7A harbors an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal RRP7 domain.	129
270469	cd14283	UBA_TNR6C	UBA domain found in trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6C protein (TNRC6C) and similar proteins. TNRC6C is one of three GW182 paralogs in mammalian genomes. It is enriched in P-bodies and important for efficient miRNA-mediated repression. TNRC6C is composed of an N-terminal glycine/tryptophan (G/W)-rich region containing an Ago hook responsible for Ago protein-binding; a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a glutamine (Q)-rich region in the middle region; a middle G/W-rich region, a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also called RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal G/W-rich region, at the C-terminus. A bipartite C-terminal region including the middle and C-terminal G/W-rich regions is referred as silencing domain that triggers silencing of bound transcripts by inhibiting protein expression and promoting mRNA decay via deadenylation. The C-terminal half containing the RRM domain functions as a key effector domain mediating protein synthesis repression by TNRC6C.	38
270470	cd14284	UBA_GAWKY	UBA domain found in Drosophila melanogaster protein Gawky (GW) and similar proteins. GW is the D. melanogaster GW182 homolog (dGW182) which belongs to the GW182 protein family. The GW182 proteins directly interact with Argonaute (Ago) proteins, and thus function as downstream effectors in the miRNA pathway, responsible for inhibition of translation and acceleration of mRNA decay. They are characterized by an abnormally high content of glycine/tryptophan (G/W) repeats, one or more glutamine (Q)-rich motifs, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also called RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The GW182 proteins are recruited to miRNA targets through an interaction between their N-terminal domain and an Argonaute protein. Then they promote translational repression and/or degradation of miRNA targets through their C-terminal silencing domain. In addition to a G/W repeats region, a Q-rich region, and a RRM domain, GW also contains a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA).	35
270551	cd14368	CUE_DEF1_like	CUE domain found in fungal RNA polymerase II degradation factor 1 (DEF1) and similar proteins. DEF1, also called RRM3-interacting protein 1, is a RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) degradation factor that may be required to couple arrested RNAPII to the proteasome to facilitate its degradation. It contains a CUE domain that is responsible for the binding of ubiquitin. The family also includes many uncharacterized hypothetical proteins. They show a high level of sequence similarity with DEF1.	41
244551	cl06904	eNOPS_SF	NOPS domain, including C-terminal helical extension region, in the p54nrb/PSF/PSP1 family. The family contains a DBHS domain (for Drosophila behavior, human splicing), which comprises two conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a charged protein-protein interaction NOPS (NONA and PSP1) domain. This model corresponds to the NOPS domain, with a long helical C-terminal extension, of paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1, also termed PSP1), a novel nucleolar factor that accumulates within a new nucleoplasmic compartment, termed paraspeckles, and diffusely distributes in the nucleoplasm. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in vertebrates. Although its cellular function remains unknown currently, PSPC1 forms a novel heterodimer with the nuclear protein p54nrb, also known as non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), which localizes to paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent manner. The NOPS domain specifically binds to the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) domain of the partner DBHS protein via a substantial interaction surface. Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for localization of these proteins to subnuclear bodies.	0
277499	cl17169	RRM_SF	RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily. The RRM motif is probably diagnostic of an RNA binding protein. RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including various hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snRNPs. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.	0
277559	cl21719	Pumilio	Pumilio-family RNA binding domain. Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. S. cerevisiae JSN1, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure.	0
249565	pfam00076	RRM_1	RNA recognition motif. (a.k.a. RRM, RBD, or RNP domain). The RRM motif is probably diagnostic of an RNA binding protein. RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including various hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snRNPs. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases The C-terminal beta strand (4th strand) and final helix are hard to align and have been omitted in the SEED alignment The LA proteins have an N terminal rrm which is included in the seed. There is a second region towards the C terminus that has some features characteristic of a rrm but does not appear to have the important structural core of a rrm. The LA proteins are one of the main autoantigens in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease.	70
250146	pfam00806	PUF	Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat. Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. S. cerevisiae JSN1, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences; some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure.	35
250935	pfam01877	RNA_binding	RNA binding. PH1010 is composed of five alpha-helices (1-5) and eight beta-strands (1-8) with the following topology: beta-1, alpha-1, beta-2, beta-3, alpha-2, alpha-3, beta-4, beta-5, alpha-4, beta-6, alpha-5, beta-7, beta-8. The first six beta-strands (1-6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel beta-sheet and face five alpha-helices on one side. The last two beta-strands form an antiparallel beta-sheet in the C-terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal.  Dimerization of the molecule is crucial for function. The structure resembles that of some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L5. Although the structure resembles that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in this family. Despite this, these proteins bind to double-stranded RNA in a non-sequence specific manner.	118
251979	pfam03468	XS	XS domain. The XS (rice gene X and SGS3) domain is found in a family of plant proteins including gene X and SGS3. SGS3 is thought to be involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). This domain contains a conserved aspartate residue that may be functionally important. The XS domain has recently been predicted to possess an RRM-like RNA-binding domain by fold recognition.	116
112856	pfam04059	RRM_2	RNA recognition motif 2. 	97
252601	pfam04446	Thg1	tRNAHis guanylyltransferase. The Thg1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for adding a GMP residue to the 5' end of tRNA His. The catalytic domain Thg1 contains a RRM (ferredoxin) fold palm domain, just like the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, family A and B DNA polymerases, adenylyl cyclases, diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF domain) and the predicted polymerase of the CRISPR system. Thg1 possesses an active site with three acidic residues that chelate Mg++ cations. Thg1 catalyzes polymerization similar to the 5'-3' polymerases.	133
113924	pfam05172	Nup35_RRM	Nup53/35/40-type RNA recognition motif. Members of this family belong to the nucleor pore complex, NPC, the only gateway between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NPC consists of several subcomplexes each one of which is made up of multiple copies of several individual Nup, Nic or Sec protein subunits. In yeast, this Nup or nucleoporin subunit is numbered Nup53, Nup40 in Schizo. pombe and in vertebrates as Nup35. This subunit forms part of the inner ring within the membrane and interacts directly with Nup-Ndc1, considered to be an anchor for the NPC in the pore membrane. This region of the Nup is the RNA-recognition region.	87
255032	pfam08777	RRM_3	RNA binding motif. This domain is found in protein La which functions as an RNA chaperone during RNA polymerase III transcription, and can also stimulate translation initiation. It contains a five stranded beta sheet which forms an atypical RNA recognition motif.	102
255108	pfam08920	SF3b1	Splicing factor 3B subunit 1. This family consists of several eukaryotic splicing factor 3B subunit 1 proteins, which associate with p14 through a C-terminus beta-strand that interacts with beta-3 of the p14 RNA recognition motif (RRM) beta-sheet, which is in turn connected to an alpha-helix by a loop that makes extensive contacts with both the shorter C-terminal helix and RRM of p14. This subunit is required for 'A' splicing complex assembly (formed by the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA) and 'E' splicing complex assembly.	142
118899	pfam10378	RRM	Putative RRM domain. This is a putative RRM, RNA-binding, domain found only in fungi. It occurs in proteins annotated as Nrd1 yeast proteins, which are known to carry RRM domains. It is not homologous with any of the other RRM domains, eg RRM_1 pfam00076.	56
255993	pfam10443	RNA12	RNA12 protein. This family includes RNA12 from S. cerevisiae. That protein contains an RRM domain. This region is C-terminal to that and includes a P-loop motif suggesting this region binds to NTP. The RNA12 proteins is involved in pre-rRNA maturation.	428
192639	pfam10598	RRM_4	RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8. The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is PrP8 which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences. Recognition of RNA targets can also be modulated by a number of other factors, most notably the two loops beta1-alpha1, beta2-beta3 and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the RNP2 domain.	94
256605	pfam11764	N-SET	COMPASS (Complex proteins associated with Set1p) component N. The n-SET or N-SET domain is a component of the COMPASS complex, associated with SET1, conserved in yeasts and in other eukaryotes up to humans. The COMPASS complex functions to methylate the fourth lysine of Histone 3 and for the silencing of genes close to the telomeres of chromosomes. This domain promotes trimethylation in conjunction with an RRM domain and is necessary for binding of the Spp1 component of COMPASS into the complex.	166
258160	pfam13893	RRM_5	RNA recognition motif. (a.k.a. RRM, RBD, or RNP domain). The RRM motif is probably diagnostic of an RNA binding protein. RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including various hnRNP proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snRNPs. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.	56

258841	pfam14703	DUF4463	Domain of unknown function (DUF4463). This is a cytosolic (predicted) domain present in integral membrane proteins, such as TM63C_HUMAN TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 63C. This domain usually preceeds a DUF221 (PF02714)domain and follows a RSN1_TM (PF13967) Fold recognition programs consistenly and with high significance predict this domain to be distantly homologous to RNA binding proteins from the RRM clan.	69
259364	pfam15230	SRRM_C	Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein C-terminus. This domain is found near to the C-terminus of Serine/arginine repetitive matrix proteins 3 and 4.	63
259650	pfam15519	RBM39linker	linker between RRM2 and RRM3 domains in RBM39 protein. A conserved linker between the second and the third RRM domain in human RBM39 (CAPER) protein, also present in other RNA binding proteins, especially those involved in RNA splicing. This linker was implicated in interactions with ESR1 and ESR2. Preliminary results from JCSG suggest that this is a structured domain with a well defined fold.	73
259758	pfam15628	RRM_DME	RRM in Demeter. This is a predicted RRM-fold domain present at the C-terminus of Demeter-like glycoslyases. These proteins are involved in DNA demethylation in plants where they catalyze removal of the 5mC base and subsequently cleave the backbone through lyase activity. Orthologs of Demeter are present in plants and stramenopiles. The RRM fold domain is predicted to facilitate interaction of the catalytic domain with ssDNA or regulatory RNA.	104

273341	TIGR00922	nusG	transcription termination/antitermination factor NusG. NusG proteins are transcription factors which are aparrently universal in prokaryotes (archaea and eukaryotes have homologs that may have related functions). The essential components of these factors include an N-terminal RNP-like (ribonucleoprotein) domain and a C-terminal KOW motif (pfam00467) believed to be a nucleic acid binding domain. In E. coli, NusA has been shown to interact with RNA polymerase and termination factor Rho. This model covers a wide variety of bacterial species but excludes mycoplasmas which are covered by a separate model (TIGR01956).The function of all of these NusG proteins is likely to be the same at the level of interaction with RNA and other protein factors to affect termination; however different species may utilize NusG towards different processes and in combination with different suites of affector proteins.In E. coli, NusG promotes rho-dependent termination. It is an essential gene. In Streptomyces virginiae and related species, an additional N-terminal sequence is also present and is suggested to play a role in butyrolactone-mediated autoregulation. In Thermotoga maritima, NusG has a long insert, fails to substitute for E. coli NusG (with or without the long insert), is a large 0.7 % of total cellular protein, and has a general, sequence non-specific DNA and RNA binding activity that blocks ethidium staining, yet permits transcription.Archaeal proteins once termed NusG share the KOW domain but are actually a ribosomal protein corresponding to L24p in bacterial and L26e in eukaryotes (TIGR00405). [Transcription, Transcription factors]	172
273727	TIGR01642	U2AF_lg	U2 snRNP auxilliary factor, large subunit, splicing factor. These splicing factors consist of an N-terminal arginine-rich low complexity domain followed by three tandem RNA recognition motifs (pfam00076). The well-characterized members of this family are auxilliary components of the U2 small nuclear ribonuclearprotein splicing factor (U2AF). These proteins are closely related to the CC1-like subfamily of splicing factors (TIGR01622). Members of this subfamily are found in plants, metazoa and fungi.	509
130706	TIGR01645	half-pint	poly-U binding splicing factor, half-pint family. The proteins represented by this model contain three RNA recognition motifs (rrm: pfam00076) and have been characterized as poly-pyrimidine tract binding proteins associated with RNA splicing factors. In the case of PUF60 (GP|6176532), in complex with p54, and in the presence of U2AF, facilitates association of U2 snRNP with pre-mRNA.	612
273732	TIGR01648	hnRNP-R-Q	heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R, Q family. Sequences in this subfamily include the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) R, Q, and APOBEC-1 complementation factor (aka APOBEC-1 stimulating protein). These proteins contain three RNA recognition domains (rrm: pfam00076) and a somewhat variable C-terminal domain.	578
273733	TIGR01649	hnRNP-L_PTB	hnRNP-L/PTB/hephaestus splicing factor family. Included in this family of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins are PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein) and hnRNP-L. These proteins contain four RNA recognition motifs (rrm: pfam00067).	481
274786	TIGR03793	TOMM_pelo	NHLP leader peptide domain. This model represents a domain that is conserved among a large number of putative ribosomal natural products (RNP) precursor, including the thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (TOMMs). As a leader peptide domain, likely to be removed from the mature product, this domain is unusual in several ways. First, it is longer than most previously described RNP leader peptides. Second, most of the domain is homologous to nitrile hydratase alpha subunits. Finally, it appears that this domain correlates with a specific family of cleavage/export proteins while members undergo modifications by different classes of peptide maturase, including cyclodehydratases, lantibiotic synthases, radical SAM peptide maturases. This family is expanded especially in Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI. [Cellular processes, Biosynthesis of natural products]	77
163507	TIGR03795	RNP_Burkhold	ribosomal natural product, two-chain TOMM family. Members of this protein family are found sparsely, mostly in members of the genus Burkholderia. Members often occur as tandem homologous genes, such as BMA_0021 and BMA_0022 in Burkholderia mallei ATCC 23344, or else have a duplication. The genes regularly are encoded near a cyclodehydrogenase/docking protein fusion protein of TOMM (thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins) biosynthetic clusters, suggesting a role in bacteriocin biosynthesis. The role of the putative natural product is unknown, but function as a two-chain bacteriocin is suggested. [Cellular processes, Biosynthesis of natural products]	114
274790	TIGR03798	ocin_TIGR03798	nif11-like leader peptide domain. This model describes a conserved, fairly long (about 65 residue) leader peptide region for a family of putative ribosomal natural products (RNP) of small size. Members of the seed alignment tend to have the Gly-Gly motif as the last two residues of the matched region. This is a cleavage site for a combination processing/export ABC transporter with a peptidase domain. Members include the prochlorosins, lantipeptides from Prochlorococcus. [Cellular processes, Biosynthesis of natural products]	64
274955	TIGR04064	rSAM_nif11	nif11-like peptide radical SAM maturase. Members of this family are radical SAM enzymes that occur co-clustered with nif11-related ribosomal natural product (RNP) precursors described by TIGRFAMs model TIGR03798. Homology within the bacteriocin family reflects largely constraints on the leader peptide, tied to processes such as cleavage and export, and members associate with various families of maturation enzyme. The gene symbol assigned is nlpM, for Nif11-class Leader Peptide family Radical SAM Maturase. [Cellular processes, Toxin production and resistance]	458
211917	TIGR04194	grasp_w_spasm_A	grasp-with-spasm leader A domain. This model describes the leader peptide domain, ending in a Gly-Gly cleavage motif, for a post-ribosomal natural product (PRNP) precursor. The corresponding modification enzymes include an ATP-GRASP enzyme and a SPASM-domain protein, related to the C-terminal region of numerous peptide-modification radical SAM enzymes.	28
211919	TIGR04196	glycopep_SunS	glycopeptide, sublancin family. Members of this family, including sublancin, are post-ribosomal natural products (PRNP) with an S-linked glycosylation. Sublancin itself also has two disulfide bonds. A related gene cluster in Bacillus cereus E33L includes the four Cys involved in the disulfide cluster but lacks the region with the glycosylated Cys, and have been excluded.	80
238053	cd00105	KH-I	K homology RNA-binding domain, type I.  KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA. It is found in a wide variety of proteins including ribosomal proteins, transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers of mRNA. There are two different KH domains that belong to different protein folds, but they share a single KH motif. The KH motif is folded into a beta alpha alpha beta unit. In addition to the core, type II KH domains (e.g. ribosomal protein S3) include N-terminal extension and type I KH domains (e.g. hnRNP K) contain C-terminal extension.	64
238194	cd00317	cyclophilin	cyclophilin: cyclophilin-type peptidylprolyl cis- trans isomerases. This family contains eukaryotic, bacterial and archeal proteins which exhibit a peptidylprolyl cis- trans isomerases activity (PPIase, Rotamase) and in addition bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin (CsA).  Immunosuppression in vertebrates is believed to be the result of the cyclophilin A-cyclosporin protein drug complex binding to and inhibiting the protein-phosphatase calcineurin.   PPIase is an enzyme which accelerates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of the peptide bonds preceding proline residues. Cyclophilins are a diverse family in terms of function and have been implicated in protein folding processes which depend on catalytic /chaperone-like activities.

211323	cd00506	PseudoU_synth_TruB_like	Pseudouridine synthase, TruB family. This group consists of eukaryotic, bacterial and archeal pseudouridine synthases similar to Escherichia coli TruB, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pus4, M.  tuberculosis TruB, S. cerevisiae Cbf5 and human dyskerin. Pseudouridine synthases catalyze the isomerization of specific uridines in an RNA molecule to pseudouridines (5-ribosyluracil, psi). No cofactors are required.  E. coli TruB, M.  tuberculosis TruB and S. cerevisiae Pus4,  make psi55 in the T loop of tRNAs. Pus4 catalyses the formation of psi55 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Psi55 is almost universally conserved. S. cerevisiae Cbf5 and human dyskerin are nucleolar proteins that, with the help of guide RNAs, make the hundreds of psueudouridnes present in rRNA and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).  Cbf5/Dyskerin is the catalytic subunit of eukaryotic box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. Mutations in human dyskerin cause X-linked dyskeratosis congenitas.	210
240668	cd00590	RRM_SF	RNA recognition motif (RRM) superfamily. RRM, also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), is a highly abundant domain in eukaryotes found in proteins involved in post-transcriptional gene expression processes including mRNA and rRNA processing, RNA export, and RNA stability. This domain is 90 amino acids in length and consists of a four-stranded beta-sheet packed against two alpha-helices. RRM usually interacts with ssRNA, but is also known to interact with ssDNA as well as proteins. RRM binds a variable number of nucleotides, ranging from two to eight. The active site includes three aromatic side-chains located within the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs of the domain. The RRM domain is found in a variety heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).	72
238354	cd00655	RNAP_Rpb7_N_like	RNAP_Rpb7_N_like: This conserved domain represents the N-terminal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) domain of the Rpb7 subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and its homologs, Rpa43 of eukaryotic RNAP I, Rpc25 of eukaryotic RNAP III, and RpoE (subunit E) of archaeal RNAP. These proteins have, in addition to their N-terminal RNP domain, a C-terminal oligonucleotide-binding (OB) domain. Each of these subunits heterodimerizes with another RNAP subunit (Rpb7 to Rpb4, Rpc25 to Rpc17, RpoE to RpoF, and Rpa43 to Rpa14). The heterodimer is thought to tether the RNAP to a given promoter via its interactions with a promoter-bound transcription factor.The heterodimer is also thought to bind and position nascent RNA as it exits the polymerase complex.	80
275447	cd01513	Translation_factor_III	Domain III of Elongation factor (EF) Tu (EF-TU), EF-G and related proteins. Elongation factors (EF) EF-Tu and EF-G participate in the elongation phase during protein biosynthesis on the ribosome. Their functional cycles depend on GTP binding and its hydrolysis. The EF-Tu complexed with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA delivers tRNA to the ribosome, whereas EF-G stimulates translocation, a process in which tRNA and mRNA movements occur in the ribosome. Experimental data showed that: (1) intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-G is influenced by excision of its domain III; (2) that EF-G lacking domain III has a 1,000-fold decreased GTPase activity on the ribosome and, a slightly decreased affinity for GTP; and (3) EF-G lacking domain III does not stimulate translocation, despite the physical presence of domain IV which is also very important for translocation. These findings indicate an essential contribution of domain III to activation of GTP hydrolysis. Domains III and V of EF-G have the same fold (although they are not completely superimposable), the double split beta-alpha-beta fold. This fold is observed in a large number of ribonucleotide binding proteins and is also referred to as the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or RNA recognition (RRM) motif. This domain III is found in several elongation factors, as well as in peptide chain release factors and in GT-1 family of GTPase (GTPBP1).	102
238772	cd01514	Elongation_Factor_C	Elongation factor G C-terminus. This domain includes the carboxyl terminal regions of elongation factors (EFs) bacterial EF-G, eukaryotic and archeal EF-2 and eukaryotic mitochondrial mtEFG1s and mtEFG2s. This group also includes proteins similar to the ribosomal protection proteins Tet(M) and Tet(O), BipA, LepA and, spliceosomal proteins: human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and yeast counterpart Snu114p.  This domain adopts a ferredoxin-like fold consisting of an alpha-beta sandwich with anti-parallel beta-sheets, resembling the topology of domain III found in the elongation factors EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2, with which it forms the C-terminal block. The two domains however are not superimposable and domain III lacks some of the characteristics of this domain.  EF-2/EF-G in complex with GTP, promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site, the uncharged tRNA from the P site to the E-site and, the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. Tet(M) and Tet(O) mediate Tc resistance. Typical Tcs bind to the ribosome and inhibit the elongation phase of protein synthesis, by inhibiting the occupation of site A by aminoacyl-tRNA. Tet(M) and Tet(O) catalyze the release of tetracycline (Tc) from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.  BipA is a highly conserved protein with global regulatory properties in Escherichia coli. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p. The function of LepA proteins is unknown.	79
238826	cd01648	TERT	TERT: Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that synthesizes telomeric DNA repeats. The telomerase RNA subunit provides the template for synthesis of these repeats. The catalytic subunit of RNP is known as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The reverse transcriptase (RT) domain is located in the C-terminal region of the TERT polypeptide. Single amino acid substitutions in this region lead to telomere shortening and senescence. Telomerase is an enzyme that, in certain cells, maintains the physical ends of chromosomes (telomeres) during replication. In somatic cells, replication of the lagging strand requires the continual presence of an RNA primer approximately 200 nucleotides upstream, which is complementary to the template strand. Since there is a region of DNA less than 200 base pairs from the end of the chromosome where this is not possible, the chromosome is continually shortened. However, a surplus of repetitive DNA at the chromosome ends protects against the erosion of gene-encoding DNA. Telomerase is not normally expressed in somatic cells. It has been suggested that exogenous TERT may extend the lifespan of, or even immortalize, the cell. However, recent studies have shown that telomerase activity can be induced by a number of oncogenes. Conversely, the oncogene c-myc can be activated in human TERT immortalized cells. Sequence comparisons place the telomerase proteins in the RT family but reveal hallmarks that distinguish them from retroviral and retrotransposon relatives.	119
238838	cd01680	EFG_like_IV	Elongation Factor G-like domain IV. This family includes the translational elongation factor termed EF-2 (for Archaea and Eukarya) and EF-G (for Bacteria), ribosomal protection proteins that mediate tetracycline resistance and, an evolutionarily conserved U5 snRNP-specific protein (U5-116kD). In complex with GTP, EF-G/EF-2  promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site of the small subunit of ribosome and the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. It has been shown that EF-G/EF-2_IV domain mimics the shape of anticodon arm of the tRNA in the structurally homologous ternary complex of Petra, EF-Tu (another transcriptional elongation factor) and GTP analog. The tip portion of this domain is found in a position that overlaps the anticodon arm of the A-site tRNA, implying that EF-G/EF-2 displaces the A-site tRNA to the P-site by physical interaction with the anticodon arm.	116

U5 snRNP is a GTP-binding factor closely related to the ribosomal translocase EF-2. In complex with GTP, EF-2 promotes the translocation step of translation. During translocation the peptidyl-tRNA is moved from the A site to the P site of the small subunit of ribosome and the mRNA is shifted one codon relative to the ribosome. It has been shown that EF-2_IV domain mimics the shape of anticodon arm of the tRNA in the structurally homologous ternary complex of Phe-tRNA, EF-1 (another transcriptional elongation factor) and GTP analog. The tip portion of this domain is found in a position that overlaps the anticodon arm of the A-site tRNA, implying that EF-2 displaces the A-site tRNA to the P-site by physical interaction with the anticodon arm.	177

The protein is structurally closely related to the eukaryotic translational elongation factor EF2. This domain has been also identified in 114kD U5-specific protein of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and may play an important role either in splicing process itself or the recycling of spliceosomal snRNP.	178

As cyclophilins, Human hCyP-A, human cyclophilin-B (hCyP-19), S. cerevisiae Cpr1 and C. elegans Cyp-3, are inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclopsporin A (CsA). CsA binds to the PPIase active site. Cyp-3. S. cerevisiae Cpr1 interacts with the Rpd3 - Sin3 complex and in addition is a component of the Set3 complex.

There are two different KH domains that belong to different protein folds, but they share a single KH motif. The KH motif is a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta unit that folds into an alpha-beta structure with a three stranded beta-sheet interupted by two contiguous helices. In addition to their KH core domain, KH-II proteins have an N-terminal alpha helical extension while KH-I proteins have a C-terminal alpha helical extension.	68
211338	cd02572	PseudoU_synth_hDyskerin	Pseudouridine synthase, human dyskerin like. This group consists of eukaryotic and archeal pseudouridine synthases similar to human dyskerin, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cbf5, and Drosophila melanogaster Mfl (minifly protein).  Pseudouridine synthases catalyze the isomerization of specific uridines in an RNA molecule to pseudouridines (5-ribosyluracil, psi).  No cofactor is required. S. cerevisiae Cbf5 and human dyskerin are nucleolar proteins that, with the help of guide RNAs, make the hundreds of psueudouridnes present in rRNA and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).  Cbf5/Dyskerin is the catalytic subunit of eukaryotic box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. D. melanogaster mfl hosts in its fourth intron, a box H/AC snoRNA gene.  In addition dyskerin is likely to have a structural role in the telomerase complex.  Mutations in human dyskerin cause X-linked dyskeratosis congenitas.

It is a component of U5 snRNP, which pre-assembles with U4/U6 snRNPs to form a [U4/U6:U5] tri-snRNP complex required for pre-mRNA splicing. Dim1 interacts with multiple splicing-associated proteins, suggesting that it functions at multiple control points in the splicing of pre-mRNA as part of a large spliceosomal complex involving many protein-protein interactions. U5 snRNP contains seven core proteins (common to all snRNPs) and nine U5-specific proteins, one of which is Dim1. Dim1 adopts a thioredoxin fold but does not contain the redox active CXXC motif. It is essential for G2/M phase transition, as a consequence to its role in pre-mRNA splicing.	114
239284	cd02986	DLP	Dim1 family, Dim1-like protein (DLP) subfamily; DLP is a novel protein which shares 38% sequence identity to Dim1. Like Dim1, it is also implicated in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle progression. DLP is located in the nucleus and has been shown to interact with the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)-specific 102kD protein (or Prp6). Dim1 protein, also known as U5 snRNP-specific 15kD protein is a component of U5 snRNP, which pre-assembles with U4/U6 snRNPs to form a [U4/U6:U5] tri-snRNP complex required for pre-mRNA splicing. Dim1 adopts a thioredoxin fold but does not contain the redox active CXXC motif.	114
239671	cd03700	eEF2_snRNP_like_II	EF2_snRNP_like_II: this subfamily represents domain II of elongation factor (EF) EF-2 found eukaryotes and archaea and, the C-terminal portion of the spliceosomal human 116kD U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein (U5-116 kD) and, its yeast counterpart Snu114p. During the process of peptide synthesis and tRNA site changes, the ribosome is moved along the mRNA a distance equal to one codon with the addition of each amino acid. This translocation step is catalyzed by EF-2_GTP, which is hydrolyzed to provide the required energy. Thus, this action releases the uncharged tRNA from the P site and transfers the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A site to the P site. Yeast Snu114p is essential for cell viability and for splicing in vivo. U5-116 kD binds GTP.  Experiments suggest that GTP binding and probably GTP hydrolysis is important for the function of the U5-116 kD/Snu114p.	93

The position of Rpa43/Rpa14 in the three-dimensional structure of RNAP I is similar to that of Rpb4/Rpb7, which forms an upstream interface between the C-terminal domain of Rpb1 and the transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), recruiting pol II to the pol II promoter. Rpb43 binds Rrn3, an rDNA-specific transcription factor, functionally equivalent to TFIIB, involved in recruiting RNAP I to the pol I promoter.	89

RpoE is composed of two domains, the N-terminal RNP (ribonucleoprotein) domain and the C-terminal S1 domain. This S1 domain binds ssRNA and ssDNA. This family is classified based on the C-terminal S1 domain. The function of RpoE is not fully understood.

It is possible that the S1 domain interacts with the nascent RNA transcript, assisted by the RNP domain. In yeast, Rpb4/Rpb7 is necessary for promoter-directed transcription initiation. They also play a role in regulating transcription-coupled repair in the Rad26-dependent pathway, in efficient mRNA export, and in transcription termination.	88
185704	cd06846	Adenylation_DNA_ligase_like	Adenylation domain of proteins similar to ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligases. ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligases catalyze the phosphodiester bond formation of nicked nucleic acid substrates using ATP as a cofactor in a three step reaction mechanism. This family includes ATP-dependent DNA and RNA ligases. DNA ligases play a vital role in the diverse processes of DNA replication, recombination and repair. ATP-dependent DNA ligases have a highly modular architecture, consisting of a unique arrangement of two or more discrete domains, including a DNA-binding domain, an adenylation or nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold domain. The adenylation domain binds ATP and contains many active site residues. Together with the C-terminal OB-fold domain, it comprises a catalytic core unit that is common to most members of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase family. The catalytic core contains six conserved sequence motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V and VI) that define this family of related nucleotidyltransferases including eukaryotic GRP-dependent mRNA-capping enzymes. The catalytic core contains both the active site as well as many DNA-binding residues. The RNA circularization protein from archaea and bacteria contains the minimal catalytic unit, the adenylation domain, but does not contain an OB-fold domain. This family also includes the m3G-cap binding domain of snurportin, a nuclear import adaptor that binds m3G-capped spliceosomal U small nucleoproteins (snRNPs), but doesn't have enzymatic activity.	182

153401	cd08032	LARP_7	La RNA-binding domain of La-related protein 7. LARP7 is a component of the 7SK snRNP, a key factor in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. 7SK functionality is dependent on the presence of LARP7, which is thought to stabilize the 7SK RNA by interacting with its 3' end. The release of 7SK RNA from P-TEFb/HEXIM/7SK complexes activates the cyclin-dependent kinase P-TEFb, which in turn phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II and mediates a transition into productive transcription elongation.	82
260030	cd08318	Death_NMPP84	Death domain of Nuclear Matrix Protein P84. Death domain (DD) found in the Nuclear Matrix Protein P84 (also known as HPR1 or THOC1). HPR1/p84 resides in the nuclear matrix and is part of the THO complex, also called TREX (transcription/export) complex, which functions in mRNP biogenesis at the interface between transcription and export of mRNA from the nucleus. Mice lacking THOC1 have abnormal testis development and are sterile. In general, DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures. Their common feature is that they form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by associating with other members of the DD superfamily including CARD (Caspase activation and recruitment domain), DED (Death Effector Domain), and PYRIN. They serve as adaptors in signaling pathways and can recruit other proteins into signaling complexes.	86
185717	cd09232	Snurportin-1_C	C-terminal m3G cap-binding domain of nuclear import adaptor snurportin-1. Snurportin-1 (SPN1 or SNUPN) is a nuclear import adaptor for m3G-capped spliceosomal U small nucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are assembled in the cytoplasm. After capping and assembly, the U snRNPs are transported into the nucleus by SPN1 and importin beta; SPN1 is then returned to the cytoplasm by exportin 1 (CRM1), which also transports the non-capped U snRNPs. The U snRNPs are essential elements of the spliceosome, which catalyzes the excision of introns and the ligation of exons to form a mature mRNA. SPN1 contains two domains, an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain and a C-terminal m3G cap-binding domain.	186
212489	cd11678	archaeal_LSm	archaeal Like-Sm protein. The archaeal Sm-like (LSm): The Sm proteins are conserved in all three domains of life and are always associated with U-rich RNA sequences. They function to mediate RNA-RNA interactions and RNA biogenesis. All Sm proteins contain a common sequence motif in two segments, Sm1 and Sm2, separated by a short variable linker. Eukaryotic Sm proteins form part of specific small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that are involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs to mature mRNAs, and are a major component of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Most snRNPs consist of seven Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F and G) arranged in a ring on a uridine-rich sequence (Sm site), plus a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (either U1, U2, U5 or U4/6). Since archaebacteria do not have any splicing apparatus, their Sm proteins may play a more general role. Archaeal LSm proteins are likely to represent the ancestral Sm domain. Members of this family share a highly conserved Sm fold containing an N-terminal helix followed by a strongly bent five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. Sm-like proteins exist in archaea as well as prokaryotes that form heptameric and hexameric ring structures similar to those found in eukaryotes.	69
212490	cd11679	archaeal_Sm_like	archaeal Sm-related protein. Archaeal Sm-related proteins: The Sm proteins are conserved in all three domains of life and are always associated with U-rich RNA sequences.

Eukaryotic Sm proteins form part of specific small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that are involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs to mature mRNAs, and are a major component of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Most snRNPs consist of seven Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F and G) arranged in a ring on a uridine-rich sequence (Sm site), plus a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (either U1, U2, U5 or U4/6). Since archaebacteria do not have any splicing apparatus, their Sm proteins may play a more general role. Archaeal Lsm proteins are likely to represent the ancestral Sm domain.	65
240451	cd11709	SPRY	SPRY domain. SPRY domains, first identified in the SP1A kinase of Dictyostelium and rabbit Ryanodine receptor (hence the name), are homologous to B30.2. SPRY domains have been identified in at least 11 protein families, covering a wide range of functions, including regulation of cytokine signaling (SOCS), RNA metabolism (DDX1 and hnRNP), immunity to retroviruses (TRIM5alpha), intracellular calcium release (ryanodine receptors or RyR) and regulatory and developmental processes (HERC1 and Ash2L). B30.2 also contains residues in the N-terminus that form a distinct PRY domain structure; i.e. B30.2 domain consists of PRY and SPRY subdomains. B30.2 domains comprise the C-terminus of three protein families: BTNs (receptor glycoproteins of immunoglobulin superfamily); several TRIM proteins (composed of RING/B-box/coiled-coil or RBCC core); Stonutoxin (secreted poisonous protein of the stonefish Synanceia horrida). While SPRY domains are evolutionarily ancient, B30.2 domains are a more recent adaptation where the SPRY/PRY combination is a possible component of immune defense. Mutations found in the SPRY-containing proteins have shown to cause Mediterranean fever and Opitz syndrome.	118
213038	cd11740	YajQ_like	Proteins similar to Escherichia coli YajQ. In Pseudomonas syringae, YajQ functions as a host protein involved in the temporal control of bacteriophage Phi6 gene transcription. It has been shown to bind to the phage's major structural core protein P1, most likely activating transcription by acting indirectly on the RNA polymerase. YajQ may remain bound to the phage particles throughout the infection period. Earlier, YajQ was characterized as a putative nucleic acid-binding protein based on the similarity of its (ferredoxin-like) three-dimensional topology with that of RNP-like RNA-binding domains.	159
240669	cd12223	RRM_SR140	RNA recognition motif (RRM) in U2-associated protein SR140 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SR140 (also termed U2 snRNP-associated SURP motif-containing protein orU2SURP, or 140 kDa Ser/Arg-rich domain protein) which is a putative splicing factor mainly found in higher eukaryotes. Although it is initially identified as one of the 17S U2 snRNP-associated proteins, the molecular and physiological function of SR140 remains unclear. SR140 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a SWAP/SURP domain that is found in a number of pre-mRNA splicing factors in the middle region, and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain (RS domain).	84
240670	cd12224	RRM_RBM22	RNA recognition motif (RRM) found in Pre-mRNA-splicing factor RBM22 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of RBM22 (also known as RNA-binding motif protein 22, or Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 16), a newly discovered RNA-binding motif protein which belongs to the SLT11 gene family. SLT11 gene encoding protein (Slt11p) is a splicing factor in yeast, which is required for spliceosome assembly. Slt11p has two distinct biochemical properties: RNA-annealing and RNA-binding activities. RBM22 is the homolog of SLT11 in vertebrate. It has been reported to be involved in pre-splicesome assembly and to interact with the Ca2+-signaling protein ALG-2. It also plays an important role in embryogenesis. RBM22 contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a zinc finger of the unusual type C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H, and a C-terminus that is unusually rich in the amino acids Gly and Pro, including sequences of tetraprolines.	74
240671	cd12225	RRM1_2_CID8_like	RNA recognition motif 1 and 2 (RRM1, RRM2) in Arabidopsis thaliana CTC-interacting domain protein CID8, CID9, CID10, CID11, CID12, CID 13 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domains found in A. thaliana CID8, CID9, CID10, CID11, CID12, CID 13 and mainly their plant homologs. These highly related RNA-binding proteins contain an N-terminal PAM2 domain (PABP-interacting motif 2), two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a basic region that resembles a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The biological role of this family remains unclear.	77
240672	cd12226	RRM_NOL8	RNA recognition motif in nucleolar protein 8 (NOL8) and similar proteins. This model corresponds to the RRM of NOL8 (also termed Nop132) encoded by a novel NOL8 gene that is up-regulated in the majority of diffuse-type, but not intestinal-type, gastric cancers. Thus, NOL8 may be a good molecular target for treatment of diffuse-type gastric cancer. Also, NOL8 is a phosphorylated protein that contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), suggesting NOL8 is likely to function as a novel RNA-binding protein. It may be involved in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level or in ribosome biogenesis in cancer cells.	78
240673	cd12227	RRM_SCAF4_SCAF8	RNA recognition motif in SR-related and CTD-associated factor 4 (SCAF4), SR-related and CTD-associated factor 8 (SCAF8) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in a new class of SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors), including SCAF4, SCAF8 and similar proteins. The biological role of SCAF4 remains unclear, but it shows high sequence similarity to SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8). SCAF8 is a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. In addition, SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF8 and SCAF4 both contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.	77
240676	cd12230	RRM1_U2AF65	RNA recognition motif 1 found in U2 large nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65) and similar proteins. The subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of U2AF65 and dU2AF50. U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies. It associates with intronless mRNAs and plays a significant and unexpected role in the nuclear export of a large number of intronless mRNAs.	82

The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM3 of U2AF65 and dU2AF50. U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies. It associates with intronless mRNAs and plays a significant and unexpected role in the nuclear export of a large number of intronless mRNAs.	89

It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a glycine hinge and a RS domain in the middle, and a C-terminal domain. The family also includes a novel group of arginine/serine (RS) or serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors existing in plants, such as A. thaliana RSp31, RSp35, RSp41 and similar proteins. Like vertebrate RS splicing factors, these proteins function as plant splicing factors and play crucial roles in constitutive and alternative splicing in plants. They all contain two RRMs at their N-terminus and an RS domain at their C-terminus.	70

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of U1-70K, also termed snRNP70, a key component of the U1 snRNP complex, which is one of the key factors facilitating the splicing of pre-mRNA via interaction at the 5' splice site, and is involved in regulation of polyadenylation of some viral and cellular genes, enhancing or inhibiting efficient poly(A) site usage. U1-70K plays an essential role in targeting the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site through protein-protein interactions with regulatory RNA-binding splicing factors, such as the RS protein ASF/SF2. Moreover, U1-70K protein can specifically bind to stem-loop I of the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) contained in the U1 snRNP complex. It also mediates the binding of U1C, another U1-specific protein, to the U1 snRNP complex. U1-70K contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by an adjacent glycine-rich region at the N-terminal half, and two serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains at the C-terminal half. The RRM is responsible for the binding of stem-loop I of U1 snRNA molecule. Additionally, the most prominent immunodominant region that can be recognized by auto-antibodies from autoimmune patients may be located within the RRM. The SR domains are involved in protein-protein interaction with SR proteins that mediate 5' splice site recognition. For instance, the first SR domain is necessary and sufficient for ASF/SF2 Binding. The family also includes Drosophila U1-70K that is an essential splicing factor required for viability in flies, but its SR domain is dispensable. The yeast U1-70k doesn't contain easily recognizable SR domains and shows low sequence similarity in the RRM region with other U1-70k proteins and therefore not included in this family. The RRM domain is dispensable for yeast U1-70K function.	91

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of SRSF11 (SRp54 or p54), SREK1 ( SFRS12 or SRrp86) and similar proteins, a group of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR protein family). These are involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. SR proteins have been identified as crucial regulators of alternative splicing. Different SR proteins display different substrate specificity, have distinct functions in alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs, and can even negatively regulate splicing. All SR family members are characterized by the presence of one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and the C-terminal regions rich in serine and arginine dipeptides (SR domains). The RRM domain is responsible for RNA binding and specificity in both alternative and constitutive splicing. In contrast, SR domains are thought to be protein-protein interaction domains that are often interchangeable. 	76
240706	cd12260	RRM2_SREK1	RNA recognition motif 2 in splicing regulatory glutamine/lysine-rich protein 1 (SREK1) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 of SREK1, also termed serine/arginine-rich-splicing regulatory protein 86-kDa (SRrp86), or splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 12 (SFRS12), or splicing regulatory protein 508 amino acid (SRrp508). SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), which is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and it may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 contains two (some contain only one) RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily. However, the EK domain is unique to SREK1. It plays a modulatory role controlling SR domain function by involvement in the inhibition of both constitutive and alternative splicing and in the selection of splice-site. 	85

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of novel nuclear proteins termed ABT1 and its homologous counterpart, pre-rRNA-processing protein ESF2 (eighteen S factor 2), from yeast. ABT1 associates with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and enhances basal transcription activity of class II promoters. Meanwhile, ABT1 could be a transcription cofactor that can bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. The yeast ABT1 homolog, ESF2, is a component of 90S preribosomes and 5' ETS-based RNPs. It is previously identified as a putative partner of the TATA-element binding protein. However, it is primarily localized to the nucleolus and physically associates with pre-rRNA processing factors. ESF2 may play a role in ribosome biogenesis. It is required for normal pre-rRNA processing, as well as for SSU processome assembly and function. Both ABT1 and ESF2 contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	98

It was originally reported as the pseudoautosomal or X inactivation escape gene 7 (XE7) and as B-lymphocyte antigen precursor. It has been suggested that AKAP-17A is an alternative splicing factor and an SR-related splicing protein that interacts with the classical SR protein ASF/SF2 and the SR-related factor ZNF265. Additional studies have indicated that AKAP-17A is a dual-specific protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) that can bind both type I and type II protein kinase A (PKA) with high affinity and co-localizes with the catalytic subunit of PKA in nuclear speckles as well as the splicing factor SC35 in splicing factor compartments. It is involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing possibly by docking a pool of PKA in splicing factor compartments. AKAP-17A contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	121

It belongs to the evolutionarily conserved REF (RNA and export factor binding proteins) family of hnRNP-like proteins. Yra1p possesses potent RNA annealing activity and interacts with a number of proteins involved in nuclear transport and RNA processing. It binds to the mRNA export factor Mex67p/TAP and couples transcription to export in yeast. Yra1p is associated with Pse1p and Kap123p, two members of the beta-importin family, further mediating transport of Yra1p into the nucleus. In addition, the co-transcriptional loading of Yra1p is required for autoregulation. Yra1p consists of two highly conserved N- and C-terminal boxes and a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). This subfamily includes RNA-annealing protein mlo3, also termed mRNA export protein mlo3, which has been identified in fission yeast as a protein that causes defects in chromosome segregation when overexpressed.

Mei2-like proteins represent an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding protein family whose corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Mei2 protein is an essential component of the switch from mitotic to meiotic growth. S. pombe Mei2 stimulates meiosis in the nucleus upon binding a specific non-coding RNA. The terminal EAR1-like protein 1 and 2 (TEL1 and TEL2) are mainly found in land plants.

It interacts with eIF-3 subunits A, G, I, and J. eIF-3B contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which is involved in the interaction with eIF-3J. The interaction between eIF-3B and eIF-3J is crucial for the eIF-3 recruitment to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF-3B also binds directly to domain III of the internal ribosome-entry site (IRES) element of hepatitis-C virus (HCV) RNA through its N-terminal RRM, which may play a critical role in both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Star-PAP, also termed RNA-binding motif protein 21 (RBM21), which is a ubiquitously expressed U6 snRNA-specific terminal uridylyltransferase (U6-TUTase) essential for cell proliferation. Although it belongs to the well-characterized poly(A) polymerase protein superfamily, Star-PAP is highly divergent from both, the poly(A) polymerase (PAP) and the terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase), identified within the editing complexes of trypanosomes. Star-PAP predominantly localizes at nuclear speckles and catalyzes RNA-modifying nucleotidyl transferase reactions. It functions in mRNA biosynthesis and may be regulated by phosphoinositides.

The corresponding coding genes of these proteins are involved in deleterious genomic rearrangements with transcription factor genes in a variety of human sarcomas and acute leukemias. All FET proteins interact with each other and are therefore likely to be part of the very same protein complexes, which suggests a general bridging role for FET proteins coupling RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. The FET proteins contain multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif at the N-terminus. The C-terminal region consists of a conserved nuclear import and retention signal (C-NLS), a putative zinc-finger domain, and a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which is flanked by 3 arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) boxes. FUS and EWS might have similar sequence specificity; both bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs.

It also functions as an important negative regulator for the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta/activin/Nodal signaling pathway by directly interacting with chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional regulators, including the R-Smads, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. Moreover, Man1 is a unique type of left-right (LR) signaling regulator that acts on the inner nuclear membrane. Man1 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.

Man1 contains an N-terminal LEM domain, two putative transmembrane domains, a MAN1-Src1p C-terminal (MSC) domain, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The LEM domain interacts with the DNA and chromatin-binding protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor, and is also necessary for efficient localization of MAN1 in the inner nuclear membrane.

It specifically binds the 3'-terminal UUU-OH motif of nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts and protects them from exonucleolytic degradation by 3' exonucleases. In addition, La can directly facilitate the translation and/or metabolism of many UUU-3' OH-lacking cellular and viral mRNAs, through binding internal RNA sequences within the untranslated regions of target mRNAs. LARP7 is an oligopyrimidine-binding protein that binds to the highly conserved 3'-terminal U-rich stretch (3' -UUU-OH) of 7SK RNA. It is a stable component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP), intimately associates with all the nuclear 7SK and is required for 7SK stability. LARP7 also acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of cellular and viral polymerase II genes, acting by means of the 7SK snRNP system. LARP7 plays an essential role in the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-dependent transcription, which has been linked to the global control of cell growth and tumorigenesis. Both La and LARP7 contain an N-terminal La motif (LAM), followed by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). 	75

240746	cd12300	RRM1_PAR14	RNA recognition motif 1 in vertebrate poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 14 (PARP-14). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of PARP-14, also termed aggressive lymphoma protein 2, a member of the B aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of macrodomain-containing PARPs. It is expressed in B lymphocytes and interacts with the IL-4-induced transcription factor Stat6. It plays a fundamental role in the regulation of IL-4-induced B-cell protection against apoptosis after irradiation or growth factor withdrawal. It mediates IL-4 effects on the levels of gene products that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and lymphomagenesis. PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional switch for Stat6-dependent gene activation. In the presence of IL-4, PARP-14 activates transcription by facilitating the binding of Stat6 to the promoter and release of HDACs from the promoter with an IL-4 signal. In contrast, in the absence of a signal, PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDACs. Moreover, the absence of PARP-14 protects against Myc-induced developmental block and lymphoma. Thus, PARP-14 may play an important role in Myc-induced oncogenesis. Research indicates that PARP-14 is also a binding partner with phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF). It can inhibit PGI/AMF ubiquitination, thus contributing to its stabilization and secretion. PARP-14 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), three tandem macro domains, and C-terminal region with sequence homology to PARP catalytic domain. 	82
240747	cd12301	RRM1_2_PAR10_like	RNA recognition motif 1 and 2 in poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase PARP-10, RNA recognition motif 2 in PARP-14, RNA recognition motif in N-myc-interactor (Nmi), interferon-induced 35 kDa protein (IFP 35), RNA-binding protein 43 (RBM43) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 and RRM2 of PARP-10, RRM2 of PARP-14, RRM of N-myc-interactor (Nmi), interferon-induced 35 kDa protein (IFP 35) and RNA-binding protein 43 (RBM43). PARP-10 is a novel oncoprotein c-Myc-interacting protein with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. It is localized to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In addition to PARP activity, PARP-10 is also involved in the control of cell proliferation by inhibiting c-Myc- and E1A-mediated cotransformation of primary cells. PARP-10 may also play a role in nuclear processes including the regulation of chromatin, gene transcription, and nuclear/cytoplasmic transport. PARP-10 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), two overlapping C-terminal domains composed of a glycine-rich region and a region with homology to catalytic domains of PARP enzymes (PARP domain). In addition, PARP-10 contains two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM). PARP-14, also termed aggressive lymphoma protein 2, is a member of the B aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of macrodomain-containing PARPs. Like PARP-10, PARP-14 also includes two RRMs at the N-terminus. Nmi, also termed N-myc and STAT interactor, is an interferon inducible protein that interacts with c-Myc, N-Myc, Max and c-Fos, and other transcription factors containing bHLH-ZIP, bHLH or ZIP domains. Besides binding Myc proteins, Nmi also associates with all the Stat family of transcription factors except Stat2. In response to cytokine (e.g. IL-2 and IFN-gamma) stimulation, Nmi can enhance Stat-mediated transcriptional activity through recruiting the Stat1 and Stat5 transcriptional coactivators, CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. IFP 35 is an interferon-induced leucine zipper protein that can specifically form homodimers. Distinct from known bZIP proteins, IFP 35 lacks a basic domain critical for DNA binding. In addition, IFP 35 may negatively regulate other bZIP transcription factors by protein-protein interaction. For instance, it can form heterodimers with B-ATF, a member of the AP1 transcription factor family. Both Nmi and IFP35 harbor one RRM. RBM43 is a putative RNA-binding protein containing one RRM, but its biological function remains unclear. 	74

It is essential for the H3 lysine-4 methylation. in vivo, and plays an important role in telomere maintenance and DNA repair in an ATM kinase Rad3-dependent pathway. spSet1p is the homology counterpart of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1p (scSet1p). However, it is more closely related to Set1 found in mammalian. Moreover, unlike scSet1p, spSet1p is not required for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast. spSet1p contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a conserved SET domain that may play a role in DNA repair and telomere function. 	86
240750	cd12304	RRM_Set1	RNA recognition motif in the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases which includes Set1A and Set1B that are ubiquitously expressed vertebrates histone methyltransferases exhibiting high homology to yeast Set1. Set1A and Set1B proteins exhibit a largely non-overlapping subnuclear distribution in euchromatic nuclear speckles, strongly suggesting that they bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. With the exception of the catalytic component, the subunit composition of the Set1A and Set1B histone methyltransferase complexes are identical. Each complex contains six human homologs of the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex, including Set1A or Set1B, Ash2 (homologous to yeast Bre2), CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1; homologous to yeast Spp1), Rbbp5 (homologous to yeast Swd1), Wdr5 (homologous to yeast Swd3), and Wdr82 (homologous to yeast Swd2). The genomic targeting of these complexes is determined by the identity of the catalytic subunit present in each histone methyltransferase complex. Thus, the Set1A and Set1B complexes may exhibit both overlapping and non-redundant properties. Both Set1A and Set1B contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), an N- SET domain, and a C-terminal catalytic SET domain followed by a post-SET domain. In contrast to Set1B, Set1A additionally contains an HCF-1 binding motif that interacts with HCF-1 in vivo. 	93

NELF is a heterotetrameric protein consisting of NELF A, B, C or the splice variant D, and E. NELF-E contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). It plays a role in the control of HIV transcription by binding to TAR RNA. In addition, NELF-E is associated with the NELF-B subunit, probably via a leucine zipper motif. 	75

PABPs are highly conserved proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3' ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs. They have been implicated in the regulation of poly(A) tail length during the polyadenylation reaction, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization by influencing the rate of deadenylation and inhibition of mRNA decapping. ePABP-2 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and PABP-2 is located in the nucleus. In contrast to the type I PABPs containing four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), the type II PABPs contains a single highly-conserved RRM. This subfamily also includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae RBP29 (SGN1, YIR001C) gene encoding cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein Rbp29 that binds preferentially to poly(A). Although not essential for cell viability, Rbp29 plays a role in modulating the expression of cytoplasmic mRNA. Like other type II PABPs, Rbp29 contains one RRM only. 	73

It contains a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides. The RRM is responsible for the specific recognition of 5'-SSNG-3' (S=C/G) RNA. In the regulation of alternative splicing events, it specifically binds to cis-regulatory elements on the pre-mRNA. The RS domain modulates SRSF2 activity through phosphorylation, directly contacts RNA, and promotes protein-protein interactions with the spliceosome. SRSF8, also termed SRP46 or SFRS2B, is a novel mammalian SR splicing factor encoded by a PR264/SC35 functional retropseudogene. SRSF8 is localized in the nucleus and does not display the same activity as PR264/SC35.

It is a serine-arginine (SR) protein that acts as a potent and general splicing repressor when dephosphorylated. It mediates global inhibition of splicing both in M phase of the cell cycle and in response to heat shock. SRSF10 emerges as a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) splicing efficiency. It also regulates cardiac-specific alternative splicing of triadin pre-mRNA and is required for proper Ca2+ handling during embryonic heart development. In contrast, the phosphorylated SRSF10 functions as a sequence-specific splicing activator in the presence of a nuclear cofactor. It activates distal alternative 5' splice site of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo. Moreover, SRSF10 strengthens pre-mRNA recognition by U1 and U2 snRNPs. SRSF10 localizes to the nuclear speckles and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm.

It is a major yeast RNA-binding protein that competes with 3'-end processing factors, such as Rna15, for binding to the nascent RNA, protecting the transcript from premature termination and coordinating transcription termination and the packaging of the fully processed transcript for export. It specifically recognizes a class of G/U-rich RNAs.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in the hnRNP C-related protein family, including hnRNP C proteins, Raly, and Raly-like protein (RALYL). hnRNP C proteins, C1 and C2, are produced by a single coding sequence. They are the major constituents of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex in vertebrates. They bind hnRNA tightly, suggesting a central role in the formation of the ubiquitous hnRNP complex; they are involved in the packaging of the hnRNA in the nucleus and in processing of pre-mRNA such as splicing and 3'-end formation. Raly, also termed autoantigen p542, is an RNA-binding protein that may play a critical role in embryonic development. The biological role of RALYL remains unclear. It shows high sequence homology with hnRNP C proteins and Raly. Members of this family are characterized by an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal auxiliary domain. The Raly proteins contain a glycine/serine-rich stretch within the C-terminal regions, which is absent in the hnRNP C proteins.

This family also includes Drosophila RNA-binding protein lark (Dlark), a homolog of human RBM4. It plays an important role in embryonic development and in the circadian regulation of adult eclosion. Dlark shares high sequence similarity with RBM4 at the N-terminal region. However, Dlark has three proline-rich segments instead of three alanine-rich segments within the C-terminal region. 	66

PGC-1beta plays a nonredundant role in controlling mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism and affects both, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis, and functions in a number of oxidative tissues. It is involved in maintaining baseline mitochondrial function and cardiac contractile function following pressure overload hypertrophy by preserving glucose metabolism and preventing oxidative stress. PGC-1beta induces hypertriglyceridemia in response to dietary fats through activating hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion. It can stimulate apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) expression, further mediating hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid. PGC-1beta also drives nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) target gene expression and NRF-1 and estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha)-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis.

NTC is composed of the scaffold protein Prp19 and a number of associated splicing factors, and plays a crucial role in intron removal during premature mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Cwc2 functions as an RNA-binding protein that can bind both small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and pre-mRNA in vitro. It interacts directly with the U6 snRNA to link the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing. In the N-terminal half, Cwc2 contains a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF domain), a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and an intervening loop, also termed RNA-binding loop or RB loop, between ZnF and RRM, all of which are necessary and sufficient for RNA binding.

The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also known as BRUNOL-2, CUG-BP1, NAPOR, EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also known as BRUNOL-3, ETR-3, CUG-BP2, NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also known as BRUNOL-1, TNRC4, ETR-1, CAGH4, ER DA4), CELF-4 (BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (BRUNOL-5) and CELF-6 (BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both, sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6.

It strongly stimulates GnRH intron A excision in a dose-dependent manner.

It has a variety of biological functions mostly related to the regulation of cellular response to DNA damage and other types of stress. Hu proteins perform their cytoplasmic and nuclear molecular functions by coordinately regulating functionally related mRNAs.

They also bind and regulate the translation of some target mRNAs, such as neurofilament M, GLUT1, and p27. In the nucleus, Hu proteins function as regulators of polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Each Hu protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). RRM1 and RRM2 may cooperate in binding to an ARE.

240827	cd12381	RRM4_I_PABPs	RNA recognition motif 4 in type I polyadenylate-binding proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM4 of type I poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), highly conserved proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3' ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs. They have been implicated in theThe CD corresponds to the RRM. regulation of poly(A) tail length during the polyadenylation reaction, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization by influencing the rate of deadenylation and inhibition of mRNA decapping. The family represents type I polyadenylate-binding proteins (PABPs), including polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP-1 or PABPC1), polyadenylate-binding protein 3 (PABP-3 or PABPC3), polyadenylate-binding protein 4 (PABP-4 or APP-1 or iPABP), polyadenylate-binding protein 5 (PABP-5 or PABPC5), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like (PABP-1-like or PABPC1L), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like 2 (PABPC1L2 or RBM32), polyadenylate-binding protein 4-like (PABP-4-like or PABPC4L), yeast polyadenylate-binding protein, cytoplasmic and nuclear (PABP or ACBP-67), and similar proteins. PABP-1 is an ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that may play a role in 3' end formation of mRNA, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization, protection of poly(A) from nuclease activity, mRNA deadenylation, inhibition of mRNA decapping, and mRNP maturation. Although PABP-1 is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, it is also found in the nucleus. PABP-1 may be involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and utilization of mRNP particles. PABP-1 contains four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), a less well conserved linker region, and a proline-rich C-terminal conserved domain (CTD). PABP-3 is a testis-specific poly(A)-binding protein specifically expressed in round spermatids. It is mainly found in mammalian and may play an important role in the testis-specific regulation of mRNA homeostasis. PABP-3 shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1. However, it binds to poly(A) with a lower affinity than PABP-1. Moreover, PABP-1 possesses an A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR and allows binding of PABP and blockage of translation of its own mRNA. In contrast, PABP-3 lacks the A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR. PABP-4 is an inducible poly(A)-binding protein (iPABP) that is primarily localized to the cytoplasm. It shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1 as well. The RNA binding properties of PABP-1 and PABP-4 appear to be identical. PABP-5 is encoded by PABPC5 gene within the X-specific subinterval, and expressed in fetal brain and in a range of adult tissues in mammalian, such as ovary and testis. It may play an important role in germ cell development. Moreover, unlike other PABPs, PABP-5 contains only four RRMs, but lacks both the linker region and the CTD. PABP-1-like and PABP-1-like 2 are the orthologs of PABP-1. PABP-4-like is the ortholog of PABP-5. Their cellular functions remain unclear. The family also includes the yeast PABP, a conserved poly(A) binding protein containing poly(A) tails that can be attached to the 3'-ends of mRNAs. The yeast PABP and its homologs may play important roles in the initiation of translation and in mRNA decay. Like vertebrate PABP-1, the yeast PABP contains four RRMs, a linker region, and a proline-rich CTD as well. The first two RRMs are mainly responsible for specific binding to poly(A). The proline-rich region may be involved in protein-protein interactions. 	79
240828	cd12382	RRM_RBMX_like	RNA recognition motif in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (hnRNP G), Y chromosome RNA recognition motif 1 (hRBMY), testis-specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G-T (hnRNP G-T) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of hnRNP G, also termed glycoprotein p43 or RBMX, an RNA-binding motif protein located on the X chromosome. It is expressed ubiquitously and has been implicated in the splicing control of several pre-mRNAs. Moreover, hnRNP G may function as a regulator of transcription for SREBP-1c and GnRH1. Research has shown that hnRNP G may also act as a tumor-suppressor since it upregulates the Txnip gene and promotes the fidelity of DNA end-joining activity. In addition, hnRNP G appears to play a critical role in proper neural development of zebrafish and frog embryos. The family also includes several paralogs of hnRNP G, such as hRBMY and hnRNP G-T (also termed RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked-like-2). Both, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T, are exclusively expressed in testis and critical for male fertility. Like hnRNP G, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T interact with factors implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, such as hTra2-beta1 and T-STAR. Although members in this family share a high conserved N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), they appear to recognize different RNA targets. For instance, hRBMY interacts specifically with a stem-loop structure in which the loop is formed by the sequence CA/UCAA. In contrast, hnRNP G associates with single stranded RNA sequences containing a CCA/C motif. In addition to the RRM, hnRNP G contains a nascent transcripts targeting domain (NTD) in the middle region and a novel auxiliary RNA-binding domain (RBD) in its C-terminal region. The C-terminal RBD exhibits distinct RNA binding specificity, and would play a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing by hnRNP G. 	80

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM42 which has been identified as a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K)-binding protein. It also directly binds the 3' untranslated region of p21 mRNA that is one of the target mRNAs for hnRNP K. Both, hnRNP K and RBM42, are components of stress granules (SGs). Under nonstress conditions, RBM42 predominantly localizes within the nucleus and co-localizes with hnRNP K. Under stress conditions, hnRNP K and RBM42 form cytoplasmic foci where the SG marker TIAR localizes, and may play a role in the maintenance of cellular ATP level by protecting their target mRNAs. RBM42 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	83

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM24 and RBM38 from vertebrate, SUPpressor family member SUP-12 from Caenorhabditis elegans and similar proteins. Both, RBM24 and RBM38, are preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. They regulate myogenic differentiation by controlling the cell cycle in a p21-dependent or -independent manner. RBM24, also termed RNA-binding region-containing protein 6, interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of myogenin mRNA and regulates its stability in C2C12 cells. RBM38, also termed CLL-associated antigen KW-5, or HSRNASEB, or RNA-binding region-containing protein 1(RNPC1), or ssDNA-binding protein SEB4, is a direct target of the p53 family. It is required for maintaining the stability of the basal and stress-induced p21 mRNA by binding to their 3'-UTRs. It also binds the AU-/U-rich elements in p63 3'-UTR and regulates p63 mRNA stability and activity. SUP-12 is a novel tissue-specific splicing factor that controls muscle-specific splicing of the ADF/cofilin pre-mRNA in C. elegans. All family members contain a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	76

It also preferentially binds to poly(G) and poly(U) RNA homopolymers. Moreover, hnRNP M is able to interact with early spliceosomes, further influencing splicing patterns of specific pre-mRNAs. hnRNP M functions as the receptor of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) that contains the penta-peptide sequence PELPK signaling motif. In addition, hnRNP M and another splicing factor Nova-1 work together as dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) pre-mRNA-binding proteins. They regulate alternative splicing of D2R pre-mRNA in an antagonistic manner. hnRNP M contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and an unusual hexapeptide-repeat region rich in methionine and arginine residues (MR repeat motif). MEF-2 is a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein that binds specifically to ssDNA derived from the proximal (MB1) element of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter and represses transcription of the MBP gene. MEF-2 shows high sequence homology with hnRNP M. It also contains three RRMs, which may be responsible for its ssDNA binding activity. 	76

240834	cd12388	RRM1_RAVER	RNA recognition motif 1 in ribonucleoprotein PTB-binding raver-1, raver-2 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of raver-1 and raver-2. Raver-1 is a ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that serves as a co-repressor of the nucleoplasmic splicing repressor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-directed splicing of select mRNAs. It shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and can accumulate in the perinucleolar compartment, a dynamic nuclear substructure that harbors PTB. Raver-1 also modulates focal adhesion assembly by binding to the cytoskeletal proteins, including alpha-actinin, vinculin, and metavinculin (an alternatively spliced isoform of vinculin) at adhesion complexes, particularly in differentiated muscle tissue. Raver-2 is a novel member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. It shows high sequence homology to raver-1. Raver-2 exerts a spatio-temporal expression pattern during embryogenesis and is mainly limited to differentiated neurons and glia cells. Although it displays nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in heterokaryons, raver2 localizes to the nucleus in glia cells and neurons. Raver-2 can interact with PTB and may participate in PTB-mediated RNA-processing. However, there is no evidence indicating that raver-2 can bind to cytoplasmic proteins. Both, raver-1 and raver-2, contain three N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), two putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) at the N- and C-termini, a central leucine-rich region, and a C-terminal region harboring two [SG][IL]LGxxP motifs.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of SART3, also termed Tat-interacting protein of 110 kDa (Tip110), an RNA-binding protein expressed in the nucleus of the majority of proliferating cells, including normal cells and malignant cells, but not in normal tissues except for the testes and fetal liver. It is involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing probably via its complex formation with RNA-binding protein with a serine-rich domain (RNPS1), a pre-mRNA-splicing factor. SART3 has also been identified as a nuclear Tat-interacting protein that regulates Tat transactivation activity through direct interaction and functions as an important cellular factor for HIV-1 gene expression and viral replication. In addition, SART3 is required for U6 snRNP targeting to Cajal bodies.

It is located in the nucleoplasm, but outside the nucleolus. ZCRB1 is one of the components of U11/U12 snRNPs that bind to U12-type pre-mRNAs and form a di-snRNP complex, simultaneously recognizing the 5' splice site and branchpoint sequence. ZCRB1 is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a CCHC-type Zinc finger motif.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. The family also includes yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. RNA15 is a core subunit of cleavage factor IA (CFIA), an essential transcriptional 3'-end processing factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RNA recognition by CFIA is mediated by an N-terminal RRM, which is contained in the RNA15 subunit of the complex. The RRM of RNA15 has a strong preference for GU-rich RNAs, mediated by a binding pocket that is entirely conserved in both yeast and vertebrate RNA15 orthologs.	75

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of eIF-4B, a multi-domain RNA-binding protein that has been primarily implicated in promoting the binding of 40S ribosomal subunits to mRNA during translation initiation. It contains two RNA-binding domains; the N-terminal well-conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), binds the 18S rRNA of the 40S ribosomal subunit and the C-terminal basic domain (BD), including two arginine-rich motifs (ARMs), binds mRNA during initiation, and is primarily responsible for the stimulation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A. eIF-4B also contains a DRYG domain (a region rich in Asp, Arg, Tyr, and Gly amino acids) in the middle, which is responsible for both, self-association of eIF-4B and  binding to the p170 subunit of eIF3. Additional research indicates that eIF-4B can interact with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in mammalian cells, which can stimulate both, the eIF-4B-mediated activation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A and binding of poly(A) by PABP. eIF-4B has also been shown to interact specifically with the internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) of several picornaviruses which facilitate cap-independent translation initiation. 	77

Nucleolin is a multifunctional major nucleolar phosphoprotein that has been implicated in various metabolic processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, nucleogenesis, cell proliferation and growth, cytoplasmic-nucleolar transport of ribosomal components, transcriptional repression, replication, signal transduction, inducing chromatin decondensation, etc. Nucleolin exhibits intrinsic self-cleaving, DNA helicase, RNA helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. It can be phosphorylated by many protein kinases, such as the major mitotic kinase Cdc2, casein kinase 2 (CK2), and protein kinase C-zeta. Nucleolin shares similar domain architecture with gar2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and NSR1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The highly phosphorylated N-terminal domain of nucleolin is made up of highly acidic regions separated from each other by basic sequences, and contains multiple phosphorylation sites. The central domain of nucleolin contains four closely adjacent N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), which suggests that nucleolin is potentially able to interact with multiple RNA targets. The C-terminal RGG (or GAR) domain of nucleolin is rich in glycine, arginine and phenylalanine residues, and contains high levels of NG,NG-dimethylarginines. RRM1, together with RRM2, binds specifically to RNA stem-loops containing the sequence (U/G)CCCG(A/G) in the loop.  	75

240853	cd12407	RRM_FOX1_like	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA binding protein fox-1 homologs and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of several tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms of vertebrate RNA binding protein Fox-1 homologs, which show high sequence similarity to the Caenorhabditis elegans feminizing locus on X (Fox-1) gene encoding Fox-1 protein. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 1 (RBFOX1), also termed ataxin-2-binding protein 1 (A2BP1), or Fox-1 homolog A, or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 1 (HRNBP1), is predominantly expressed in neurons, skeletal muscle and heart. It regulates alternative splicing of tissue-specific exons by binding to UGCAUG elements. Moreover, RBFOX1 binds to the C-terminus of ataxin-2 and forms an ataxin-2/A2BP1 complex involved in RNA processing. RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2), also termed Fox-1 homolog B, or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2 (HRNBP2), or RNA-binding motif protein 9 (RBM9), or repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity, is expressed in ovary, whole embryo, and human embryonic cell lines in addition to neurons and muscle. RBFOX2 activates splicing of neuron-specific exons through binding to downstream UGCAUG elements. RBFOX2 also functions as a repressor of tamoxifen activation of the estrogen receptor. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 3 (RBFOX3 or NeuN or HRNBP3), also termed Fox-1 homolog C, is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of the RBFOX2 pre-mRNA, producing a message encoding a dominant negative form of the RBFOX2 protein. Its message is detected exclusively in post-mitotic regions of embryonic brain. Like RBFOX1, both RBFOX2 and RBFOX3 bind to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG elements and modulate brain and muscle-specific splicing of exon EIIIB of fibronectin, exon N1 of c-src, and calcitonin/CGRP. Members in this family also harbor one RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). 	76

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of eIF-3G and similar proteins. eIF-3G, also termed eIF-3 subunit 4, or eIF-3-delta, or eIF3-p42, or eIF3-p44, is the RNA-binding subunit of eIF3, a large multisubunit complex that plays a central role in the initiation of translation by binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and promoting the binding of methionyl-tRNAi and mRNA. eIF-3G binds 18 S rRNA and beta-globin mRNA, and therefore appears to be a nonspecific RNA-binding protein. eIF-3G is one of the cytosolic targets and interacts with mature apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). eIF-3G contains one RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). This family also includes yeast eIF3-p33, a homolog of vertebrate eIF-3G, plays an important role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in yeast.

Gene IST3 encoding ist3, also termed U2 snRNP protein SNU17 (Snu17p), is a novel yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein required for the first catalytic step of splicing and for progression of spliceosome assembly. It binds specifically to the U2 snRNP and is an intrinsic component of prespliceosomes and spliceosomes. Yeast ist3 contains an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). In the yeast pre-mRNA retention and splicing complex, the atypical RRM of ist3 functions as a scaffold that organizes the other two constituents, Bud13p (bud site selection 13) and Pml1p (pre-mRNA leakage 1). Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene cwf29 encoding ist3, also termed cell cycle control protein cwf29, is an RNA-binding protein complexed with cdc5 protein 29. It also contains one RRM. The biological function of RBMX2 remains unclear. It shows high sequence similarity to yeast ist3 protein and harbors one RRM as well. 	89
240858	cd12412	RRM_DAZL_BOULE	RNA recognition motif in AZoospermia (DAZ) autosomal homologs, DAZL (DAZ-like) and BOULE. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of two Deleted in AZoospermia (DAZ) autosomal homologs, DAZL (DAZ-like) and BOULE. BOULE is the founder member of the family and DAZL arose from BOULE in an ancestor of vertebrates. The DAZ gene subsequently originated from a duplication transposition of the DAZL gene. Invertebrates contain a single DAZ homolog, BOULE, while vertebrates, other than catarrhine primates, possess both BOULE and DAZL genes. The catarrhine primates possess BOULE, DAZL, and DAZ genes. The family members encode closely related RNA-binding proteins that are required for fertility in numerous organisms. These proteins contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a varying number of copies of a DAZ motif, believed to mediate protein-protein interactions. DAZL and BOULE contain a single copy of the DAZ motif, while DAZ proteins can contain 8-24 copies of this repeat. Although their specific biochemical functions remain to be investigated, DAZL proteins may interact with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), and act as translational activators of specific mRNAs during gametogenesis.  	80

240863	cd12417	RRM_SAFB_like	RNA recognition motif in the scaffold attachment factor (SAFB) family. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of the SAFB family, including scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), scaffold attachment factor B2 (SAFB2), SAFB-like transcriptional modulator (SLTM), and similar proteins, which are ubiquitously expressed. SAFB1, SAFB2 and SLTM have been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis. They share high sequence similarities and all contain a scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain) DNA-binding motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region rich in glutamine and arginine residues. SAFB1 is a nuclear protein with a distribution similar to that of SLTM, but unlike that of SAFB2, which is also found in the cytoplasm. To a large extent, SAFB1 and SLTM might share similar functions, such as the inhibition of an oestrogen reporter gene. The additional cytoplasmic localization of SAFB2 implies that it could play additional roles in the cytoplasmic compartment which are distinct from the nuclear functions shared with SAFB1 and SLTM. 	74
240864	cd12418	RRM_Aly_REF_like	RNA recognition motif in the Aly/REF family. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of  Aly/REF family which includes THO complex subunit 4 (THOC4, also termed Aly/REF), S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (SKAR, also termed PDIP3 or PDIP46) and similar proteins. THOC4 is an mRNA transporter protein with a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). It is involved in RNA transportation from the nucleus, and was initially identified as a transcription coactivator of LEF-1 and AML-1 for the TCRalpha enhancer function. In addition, THOC4 specifically binds to rhesus (RH) promoter in erythroid, and might be a novel transcription cofactor for erythroid-specific genes. SKAR shows high sequence homology with THOC4 and possesses one RRM as well. SKAR is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus. It may be a critical player in the function of S6K1 in cell and organism growth control by binding the activated, hyperphosphorylated form of S6K1 but not S6K2. Furthermore, SKAR functions as a protein partner of the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In addition, SKAR may have particular importance in pancreatic beta cell size determination and insulin secretion. 	75

RBP-MS may be involved in regulation of mRNA translation and localization during Xenopus laevis development. It has also been shown to physically interact with Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4, and stimulates Smad-mediated transactivation. Cpo may play an important role in regulating normal function of the nervous system, whereas mutations in Mec-8 affect mechanosensory and chemosensory neuronal function. All members contain a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). Some uncharacterized family members contain two RRMs; this subfamily includes their RRM1. Their RRM2 shows high sequence homology to the RRM of yeast proteins scw1, Whi3, and Whi4.	79

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. Rod1 is a mammalian polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It might play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. hnRNP-L is a higher eukaryotic specific subunit of human KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) complex required for histone H3 Lys-36 trimethylation activity. It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. The family also includes polypyrimidine tract binding protein homolog 3 (PTBPH3) found in plant. Although its biological roles remain unclear, PTBPH3 shows significant sequence similarity to other family members, all of which contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). Although their biological roles remain unclear, both PTBPH1 and PTBPH2 show significant sequence similarity to PTB.

It may also interact with a group of nucleoporins including Nup93, Nup155, and Nup205 and play a role in the association of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad1 with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The family also includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup53p, an ortholog of vertebrate nucleoporin Nup53. A unique property of yeast Nup53p is that it contains an additional Kap121p-binding domain and interacts specifically with the karyopherin Kap121p, which is involved in the assembly of Nup53p into NPCs. Both, vertebrate Nup35 and yeast Nup53p, contain an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix and several FG repeats.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of the CPEB family of proteins that bind to defined groups of mRNAs and act as either translational repressors or activators to regulate their translation. CPEB proteins are well conserved in both, vertebrates and invertebrates. Based on sequence similarity, RNA-binding specificity, and functional regulation of translation, the CPEB proteins have been classified into two subfamilies. The first subfamily includes CPEB-1 and related proteins. CPEB-1 is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), a short U-rich motif in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain mRNAs. It functions as a translational regulator that plays a major role in the control of maternal CPE-containing mRNA in oocytes, as well as of subsynaptic CPE-containing mRNA in neurons. Once phosphorylated and recruiting the polyadenylation complex, CPEB-1 may function as a translational activator stimulating polyadenylation and translation. Otherwise, it may function as a translational inhibitor when dephosphorylated and bind to a protein such as maskin or neuroguidin, which blocks translation initiation through interfering with the assembly of eIF-4E and eIF-4G. Although CPEB-1 is mainly located in cytoplasm, it can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. The second subfamily includes CPEB-2, CPEB-3, CPEB-4, and related protiens. Due to high sequence similarity, members in this subfamily may share similar expression patterns and functions. CPEB-2 is an RNA-binding protein that is abundantly expressed in testis and localized in cytoplasm in transfected HeLa cells. It preferentially binds to poly(U) RNA oligomers and may regulate the translation of stored mRNAs during spermiogenesis. CPEB-2 impedes target RNA translation at elongation; it directly interacts with the elongation factor, eEF2, to reduce eEF2/ribosome-activated GTP hydrolysis in vitro and inhibit peptide elongation of CPEB2-bound RNA in vivo. CPEB-3 is a sequence-specific translational regulatory protein that regulates translation in a polyadenylation-independent manner. It functions as a translational repressor that governs the synthesis of the AMPA receptor GluR2 through binding GluR2 mRNA. It also represses translation of a reporter RNA in transfected neurons and stimulates translation in response to NMDA. CPEB-4 is an RNA-binding protein that mediates meiotic mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation. It is essential for neuron survival and present on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is accumulated in the nucleus upon ischemia or the depletion of ER calcium. CPEB-4 is overexpressed in a large variety of tumors and is associated with many mRNAs in cancer cells. All CPEB proteins are nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling proteins. They contain an N-terminal unstructured region, followed by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a Zn-finger motif.

240892	cd12446	RRM_RBM25	RNA recognition motif in eukaryotic RNA-binding protein 25 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM25, also termed Arg/Glu/Asp-rich protein of 120 kDa (RED120), or protein S164, or RNA-binding region-containing protein 7, an evolutionary-conserved splicing coactivator SRm160 (SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa, )-interacting protein. RBM25 belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins containing a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), at the N-terminus, a RE/RD-rich (ER) central region, and a C-terminal proline-tryptophan-isoleucine (PWI) motif. It localizes to the nuclear speckles and associates with multiple splicing components, including splicing cofactors SRm160/300, U snRNAs, assembled splicing complexes, and spliced mRNAs. It may play an important role in pre-mRNA processing by coupling splicing with mRNA 3'-end formation. Additional research indicates that RBM25 is one of the RNA-binding regulators that direct the alternative splicing of apoptotic factors. It can activate proapoptotic Bcl-xS 5'ss by binding to the exonic splicing enhancer, CGGGCA, and stabilize the pre-mRNA-U1 snRNP through interaction with hLuc7A, a U1 snRNP-associated factor. 	84

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of two structurally related heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, CIRBP (also termed CIRP or A18 hnRNP) and RBM3 (also termed RNPL), both of which belong to a highly conserved cold shock proteins family. The cold shock proteins can be induced after exposure to a moderate cold-shock and other cellular stresses such as UV radiation and hypoxia. CIRBP and RBM3 may function in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to different transcripts, thus allowing the cell to response rapidly to environmental signals. However, the kinetics and degree of cold induction are different between CIRBP and RBM3. Tissue distribution of their expression is different. CIRBP and RBM3 may be differentially regulated under physiological and stress conditions and may play distinct roles in cold responses of cells. CIRBP, also termed glycine-rich RNA-binding protein CIRP, is localized in the nucleus and mediates the cold-induced suppression of cell cycle progression. CIRBP also binds DNA and possibly serves as a chaperone that assists in the folding/unfolding, assembly/disassembly and transport of various proteins. RBM3 may enhance global protein synthesis and the formation of active polysomes while reducing the levels of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing microRNAs. RBM3 may also serve to prevent the loss of muscle mass by its ability to decrease cell death. Furthermore, RBM3 may be essential for cell proliferation and mitosis. Both, CIRBP and RBM3, contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), that is involved in RNA binding, and C-terminal glycine-rich domain (RGG motif) that probably enhances RNA-binding via protein-protein and/or protein-RNA interactions.

It is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. SRSF11 has been identified as a tau exon 10 splicing repressor. It interacts with a purine-rich element in exon 10, and suppresses exon 10 inclusion by antagonizing Tra2beta, an SR-domain-containing protein that enhances exon 10 inclusion. SRSF11 is a unique SR family member and may regulate the alternative splicing in a tissue- and substrate-dependent manner. It can directly interact with the U2 auxiliary factor 65-kDa subunit (U2AF65), a protein associated with the 3' splice site. In addition, unlike the typical SR proteins, SRSF11 associates with other SR proteins but not with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1-70K or the U2 auxiliary factor 35-kDa subunit (U2AF35). SREK1 has unique properties in regulating alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs; it promotes the use of the distal 5' splice site in E1A pre-mRNA alternative splicing. It also inhibits cryptic splice site selection on the beta-globin pre-mRNA containing competing 5' splice sites. SREK1 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and one serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains). 	80

SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), and is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 generally contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily. However, the EK domain is unique to SREK1; plays a modulatory role controlling SR domain function by involvement in the inhibition of both constitutive and alternative splicing and in the selection of splice-site. 	80

240977	cd12533	RRM_EWS	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate Ewing Sarcoma Protein (EWS). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of EWS, also termed Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 protein, a member of the FET (previously TET) (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) family of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins whose expression is altered in cancer.

EWS is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the preinitiation complex TFIID and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes. It is also associated with splicing factors, such as the U1 snRNP protein U1C, suggesting its implication in pre-mRNA splicing. Additionally, EWS has been shown to regulate DNA damage-induced alternative splicing (AS). Like other members in the FET family, EWS contains an N-terminal Ser, Gly, Gln and Tyr-rich region composed of multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif. The C-terminal region consists of a conserved nuclear import and retention signal (C-NLS), a C2/C2 zinc-finger motif, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and at least 1 arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG)-repeat region.

240979	cd12535	RRM_FUS_TAF15	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate fused in Ewing's sarcoma protein (FUS), TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of FUS and TAF15. FUS (TLS or Pigpen or hnRNP P2), also termed 75 kDa DNA-pairing protein (POMp75), or oncoprotein TLS (Translocated in liposarcoma), is a member of the FET (previously TET) (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) family of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins whose expression is altered in cancer. It is a multi-functional protein and has been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, chromosome stability, cell spreading, and transcription. FUS was originally identified in human myxoid and round cell liposarcomas as an oncogenic fusion with the stress-induced DNA-binding transcription factor CHOP (CCAAT enhancer-binding homologous protein) and later as hnRNP P2, a component of hnRNP H complex assembled on pre-mRNA. It can form ternary complexes with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2. Additional research indicates that FUS binds preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. In the presence of Mg2+, it can bind both single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) and promote ATP-independent annealing of complementary ssDNA and D-loop formation in superhelical dsDNA. FUS has been shown to be recruited by single stranded noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, where it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation. TAF15 (TAFII68), also termed TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N (TAF2N), or RNA-binding protein 56 (RBP56), originally identified as a TAF in the general transcription initiation TFIID complex, is a novel RNA/ssDNA-binding protein with homology to the proto-oncoproteins FUS and EWS (also termed EWSR1), belonging to the FET family as well. TAF15 likely functions in RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription by interacting with TFIID and subunits of RNAP II itself.

Like other members in the FET family, both FUS and TAF15 contain an N-terminal Ser, Gly, Gln and Tyr-rich region composed of multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif. The C-terminal region consists of a conserved nuclear import and retention signal (C-NLS), a C2/C2 zinc-finger motif, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and at least 1 arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG)-repeat region. 	86

An octapeptide sequence called the RS-ERK motif is repeated six times in the RS region of RBM39.

It has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF35 directly binds to the 3' splice site of the conserved AG dinucleotide and performs multiple functions in the splicing process in a substrate-specific manner. It promotes U2 snRNP binding to the branch-point sequences of introns through association with the large subunit of U2AF, U2AF65 (also termed U2AF2). U2AF35 contains two N-terminal zinc fingers, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal arginine/serine (SR)-rich segment interrupted by glycines.

They show high sequence homology to vertebrates U2AF35 that directly binds to the 3' splice site of the conserved AG dinucleotide and performs multiple functions in the splicing process in a substrate-specific manner. U2AF35B contains two N-terminal zinc fingers, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal arginine/serine (SR)-rich domain.

Although the biological role of U2AFBPL remains unclear, it shows high sequence homology to splicing factor U2AF 35 kDa subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1) that directly binds to the 3' splice site of the conserved AG dinucleotide and performs multiple functions in the splicing process in a substrate-specific manner. Like U2AF35, U2AFBPL contains two N-terminal zinc fingers, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal arginine/serine (SR)-rich domain. 	105

In addition, La can directly facilitate the translation and/or metabolism of many UUU-3' OH-lacking cellular and viral mRNAs, through binding internal RNA sequences within the untranslated regions of target mRNAs. La contains an N-terminal La motif (LAM), followed by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). In addition, it possesses a short basic motif (SBM) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus. 	76
240986	cd12542	RRM2_LARP7	RNA recognition motif 2 in La-related protein 7 (LARP7) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of LARP7, also termed La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 7, or P-TEFb-interaction protein for 7SK stability (PIP7S), an oligopyrimidine-binding protein that binds to the highly conserved 3'-terminal U-rich stretch (3' -UUU-OH) of 7SK RNA. LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). It intimately associates with all the nuclear 7SK and is required for 7SK stability. LARP7 also acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of cellular and viral polymerase II genes, acting by means of the 7SK snRNP system. LARP7 plays an essential role in the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-dependent transcription, which has been linked to the global control of cell growth and tumorigenesis. LARP7 contains a La motif (LAM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), at the N-terminal region, which mediates binding to the U-rich 3' terminus of 7SK RNA.

240987	cd12543	RRM2_PAR14	RNA recognition motif 2 in vertebrate poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 14 (PARP-14). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of PARP-14, also termed aggressive lymphoma protein 2, a member of the B aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of macrodomain-containing PARPs. It is expressed in B lymphocytes and interacts with the IL-4-induced transcription factor Stat6. It plays a fundamental role in the regulation of IL-4-induced B-cell protection against apoptosis after irradiation or growth factor withdrawal. It mediates IL-4 effects on the levels of gene products that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and lymphomagenesis. PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional switch for Stat6-dependent gene activation. In the presence of IL-4, PARP-14 activates transcription by facilitating the binding of Stat6 to the promoter and release of HDACs from the promoter with an IL-4 signal. In contrast, in the absence of a signal, PARP-14 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDACs. Absence of PARP-14 protects against Myc-induced developmental block and lymphoma. Thus, PARP-14 may play an important role in Myc-induced oncogenesis. Additional research indicates that PARP-14 is also a binding partner with phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF). It can inhibit PGI/AMF ubiquitination, thus contributing to its stabilization and secretion. PARP-14 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), three tandem macro domains, and C-terminal region with sequence homology to PARP catalytic domain. 	74

In addition to binding Myc proteins, Nmi also associates with all the Stat family of transcription factors except Stat2. In response to cytokines (e.g. IL-2 and IFN-gamma) stimulation, Nmi can enhance Stat-mediated transcriptional activity through recruiting the Stat1 and Stat5 transcriptional coactivators, CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Nmi contains one RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	81

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM in IFP 35, an interferon-induced leucine zipper protein that can specifically form homodimers. Distinct from known bZIP proteins, IFP 35 lacks a basic domain critical for DNA binding. IFP 35 may negatively regulate other bZIP transcription factors by protein-protein interaction. For instance, it can form heterodimers with B-ATF, a member of the AP1 transcription factor family. IFP 35 contains one RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	79

It contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), two overlapping C-terminal domains composed of a glycine-rich region and a region with homology to catalytic domains of PARP enzymes (PARP domain).

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of PGC-1alpha, also termed PPARGC-1-alpha, or ligand effect modulator 6, a member of a family of transcription coactivators that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism.

PGC-1alpha stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and promotes oxidative metabolism. It participates in the regulation of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and plays a role in disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. PGC-1alpha is a multi-domain protein containing an N-terminal activation domain region, a central region involved in the interaction with at least a nuclear receptor, and a C-terminal domain region. The N-terminal domain region consists of three leucine-rich motifs (L1, NR box 2 and 3), among which the two last are required for interaction with nuclear receptors, potential nuclear localization signals (NLS), and a proline-rich region overlapping a putative repression domain.

Unlike PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta, PRC is ubiquitous and more abundantly expressed in proliferating cells than in growth-arrested cells. PRC has been implicated in the regulation of several metabolic pathways, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cell growth. It functions as a growth-regulated transcriptional cofactor activating many nuclear genes specifying mitochondrial respiratory function. PRC directly interacts with nuclear transcriptional factors implicated in respiratory chain expression including nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2), CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). It interacts indirectly with the NRF-2beta subunit through host cell factor (HCF), a cellular protein involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and cell cycle regulation.

Further research indicates that PRC may also act as a sensor of metabolic stress that orchestrates a redox-sensitive program of inflammatory gene expression. PRC is a multi-domain protein containing an N-terminal activation domain, an LXXLL coactivator signature, a central proline-rich region, a tetrapeptide motif (DHDY) responsible for HCF binding, a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (SR) domain, and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	91

241075	cd12631	RRM1_CELF1_2_Bruno	RNA recognition motif 1 in CUGBP Elav-like family member CELF-1, CELF-2, Drosophila melanogaster Bruno protein and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of CELF-1, CELF-2 and Bruno protein. CELF-1 (also termed BRUNOL-2, or CUG-BP1, or EDEN-BP) and CELF-2 (also termed BRUNOL-3, or ETR-3, or CUG-BP2, or NAPOR) belong to the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) family of RNA-binding proteins that have been implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and control of mRNA translation and deadenylation. CELF-1 is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. The human CELF-1 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing, with implications for onset of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), a neuromuscular disease associated with an unstable CUG triplet expansion in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene; it preferentially targets UGU-rich mRNA elements. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It binds specifically to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity; it binds preferentially to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. It also binds to the 3'-UTR of cyclooxygenase-2 messages, affecting both translation and mRNA stability, and binds to apoB mRNA, regulating its C to U editing. CELF-2 also contains three highly conserved RRMs. It binds to RNA via the first two RRMs, which are also important for localization in the cytoplasm. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-2 on some specific substrates is mediated by RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-2, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. In addition, CELF-2 possesses a typical arginine and lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus, within RRM3. This subgroup also includes Drosophila melanogaster Bruno protein, which plays a central role in regulation of Oskar (Osk) expression in flies.

It binds to mRNAs and enhances the expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins, such as p21waf1, p53, and prothymosin alpha. HuR also has pro-apoptotic function by promoting apoptosis when cell death is unavoidable. Furthermore, HuR may be important in muscle differentiation, adipogenesis, suppression of inflammatory response and modulation of gene expression in response to chronic ethanol exposure and amino acid starvation. Hu proteins perform their cytoplasmic and nuclear molecular functions by coordinately regulating functionally related mRNAs. In the cytoplasm, Hu proteins recognize and bind to AU-rich RNA elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain target mRNAs, such as GAP-43, vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), the glucose transporter GLUT1, eotaxin and c-fos, and stabilize those ARE-containing mRNAs. They also bind and regulate the translation of some target mRNAs, such as neurofilament M, GLUT1, and p27. In the nucleus, Hu proteins function as regulators of polyadenylation and alternative splicing. Each Hu protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). RRM1 and RRM2 may cooperate in binding to an ARE.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of Nop12p which is encoded by YOL041C from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is a novel nucleolar protein required for pre-25S rRNA processing and normal rates of cell growth at low temperatures. Nop12p shares high sequence similarity with nucleolar protein 13 (Nop13p). Both, Nop12p and Nop13p, are not essential for growth. However, unlike Nop13p that localizes primarily to the nucleolus but also present in the nucleoplasm to a lesser extent, Nop12p is localized to the nucleolus.

241115	cd12671	RRM_CSTF2_CSTF2T	RNA recognition motif in cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2), cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 tau variant (CSTF2T) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. 	75

241117	cd12673	RRM_BOULE	RNA recognition motif in protein BOULE. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of BOULE, the founder member of the human DAZ gene family. Invertebrates contain a single BOULE, while vertebrates, other than catarrhine primates, possess both BOULE and DAZL genes. The catarrhine primates possess BOULE, DAZL, and DAZ genes. BOULE encodes an RNA-binding protein containing an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a single copy of the DAZ motif. Although its specific biochemical functions remains to be investigated, BOULE protein may interact with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), and act as translational activators of specific mRNAs during gametogenesis. 	81

241122	cd12678	RRM_SLTM	RNA recognition motif in Scaffold attachment factor (SAF)-like transcription modulator (SLTM) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of SLTM, also termed modulator of estrogen-induced transcription, which shares high sequence similarity with scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1). It contains a scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain) DNA-binding motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region rich in glutamine and arginine residues. To a large extent, SLTM co-localizes with SAFB1 in the nucleus, which suggests that they share similar functions, such as the inhibition of an oestrogen reporter gene. However, rather than mediating a specific inhibitory effect on oestrogen action, SLTM is shown to exert a generalized inhibitory effect on gene expression associated with induction of apoptosis in a wide range of cell lines. 	74
241123	cd12679	RRM_SAFB1_SAFB2	RNA recognition motif in scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), scaffold attachment factor B2 (SAFB2), and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to RRM of SAFB1, also termed scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B), heat-shock protein 27 estrogen response element ERE and TATA-box-binding protein (HET), or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP A1- associated protein (HAP), a large multi-domain protein with well-described functions in transcriptional repression, RNA splicing and metabolism, and a proposed role in chromatin organization. Based on the numerous functions, SAFB1 has been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis. SAFB1 specifically binds to AT-rich scaffold or matrix attachment region DNA elements (S/MAR DNA) by using its N-terminal scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain), a homeodomain-like DNA binding motif. The central region of SAFB1 is composed of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminus of SAFB1 contains Glu/Arg- and Gly-rich regions that might be involved in protein-protein interaction. Additional studies indicate that the C-terminal region contains a potent and transferable transcriptional repression domain. Another family member is SAFB2, a homolog of SAFB1. Both SAFB1 and SAFB2 are ubiquitously coexpressed and share very high sequence similarity, suggesting that they might function in a similar manner. However, unlike SAFB1, exclusively existing in the nucleus, SAFB2 is also present in the cytoplasm. The additional cytoplasmic localization of SAFB2 implies that it could play additional roles in the cytoplasmic compartment which are distinct from the nuclear functions shared with SAFB1.	76
241124	cd12680	RRM_THOC4	RNA recognition motif in THO complex subunit 4 (THOC4) and similar proteins.

It is involved in RNA transportation from the nucleus. THOC4 was initially identified as a transcription coactivator of LEF-1 and AML-1 for the TCRalpha enhancer function. In addition, THOC4 specifically binds to rhesus (RH) promoter in erythroid. It might be a novel transcription cofactor for erythroid-specific genes. 	75
241125	cd12681	RRM_SKAR	RNA recognition motif in S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (SKAR) and similar proteins.

SKAR is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus.

MATR3 has been implicated in various biological processes. It is involved in RNA processing by interacting with other nuclear proteins to anchor hyperedited RNAs to the nuclear matrix. It plays a role in mRNA stabilization through maintaining the stability of certain mRNA species. Besides, it modulates the activity of proximal promoters by binding to highly repetitive sequences of matrix/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR). The phosphorylation of MATR3 is assumed to cause neuronal death. It is phosphorylated by the protein kinase ATM, which activates the cellular response to double strand breaks in the DNA. Its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) is responsible for the activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor. Furthermore, MATR3 has been identified as both a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding protein and a downstream substrate of caspases.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of Matrin 3 (MATR3 or P130), a highly conserved inner nuclear matrix protein with a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), two zinc finger domains predicted to bind DNA, and two RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), that are known to interact with RNA. MATR3 has been implicated in various biological processes. It is involved in RNA processing by interacting with other nuclear proteins to anchor hyperedited RNAs to the nuclear matrix. It plays a role in mRNA stabilization through maintaining the stability of certain mRNA species. Besides, it modulates the activity of proximal promoters by binding to highly repetitive sequences of matrix/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR). The phosphorylation of MATR3 is assumed to cause neuronal death. It is phosphorylated by the protein kinase ATM, which activates the cellular response to double strand breaks in the DNA. Its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) is responsible for the activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor. Furthermore, MATR3 has been identified as both a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding protein and a downstream substrate of caspases. Additional research indicates that matrin 3 also binds Rev/Rev responsive element (RRE)-containing viral RNA and functions as a cofactor that mediates the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1. 	80

241222	cd12778	RRM1_PTBP2	RNA recognition motif 1 in vertebrate polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of PTBP2, also known as neural polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or neurally-enriched homolog of PTB (nPTB), highly homologous to polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). 	82

PTB contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). RRM1 and RRM2 are independent from each other and separated by flexible linkers. By contrast, there is an unusual and conserved interdomain interaction between RRM3 and RRM4. It is widely held that only RRMs 3 and 4 are involved in RNA binding and RRM2 mediates PTB homodimer formation. However, new evidence shows that the RRMs 1 and 2 also contribute substantially to RNA binding. Moreover, PTB may not always dimerize to repress splicing. It is a monomer in solution. 	100

The NOPS domain specifically binds to RRM2 domain of the partner DBHS protein via a substantial interaction surface. Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for localization of these proteins to subnuclear bodies. PSF has an additional large N-terminal domain that differentiates it from other family members. The p54nrb/PSF/PSP1 family includes 54 kDa nuclear RNA- and DNA-binding protein (p54nrb), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-associated-splicing factor (PSF) and paraspeckle protein 1 (PSP1), which are ubiquitously expressed and are well conserved in vertebrates. p54nrb, also termed NONO or NMT55, is a multi-functional protein involved in numerous nuclear processes including transcriptional regulation, splicing, DNA unwinding, nuclear retention of hyperedited double-stranded RNA, viral RNA processing, control of cell proliferation, and circadian rhythm maintenance.

Man1, also termed LEM domain-containing protein 3 (LEMD3), is an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that binds to nuclear lamins and emerin, thus playing a role in nuclear organization. It is part of a protein complex essential for chromatin organization and cell division.

270991	cd14089	STKc_MAPKAPK	Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine kinases, Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinases. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily is composed of the MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2, MK3, MK5 (also called PRAK for p38-regulated/activated protein kinase), and related proteins. These proteins contain a catalytic kinase domain followed by a C-terminal autoinhibitory region that contains nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export (NES) signals with a p38 MAPK docking motif that overlaps the NLS. In addition, MK2 and MK3 contain an N-terminal proline-rich region that can bind to SH3 domains. MK2 and MK3 are bonafide substrates for the MAPK p38, while MK5 plays a functional role in the p38 MAPK pathway although their direct interaction has been difficult to detect. MK2 and MK3 are closely related and show, thus far, indistinguishable substrate specificity, while MK5 shows a distinct spectrum of substrates. MK2 and MK3 are mainly involved in the regulation of gene expression and they participate in diverse cellular processes such as endocytosis, cytokine production, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling. They are implicated in inflammation and cance and their substrates include mRNA-AU-rich-element (ARE)-binding proteins (TTP and hnRNP A0), Hsp proteins (Hsp27 and Hsp25) and RSK, among others. MK2/3 are both expressed ubiquitously but MK2 is expressed at significantly higher levels. MK5 is a ubiquitous protein that is implicated in neuronal morphogenesis, cell migration, and tumor angiogenesis. It interacts with PKA, which induces cytoplasmic translocation of MK5. Its substrates includes p53, ERK3/4, Hsp27, and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2).

271037	cd14135	STKc_PRP4	Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, Pre-mRNA-Processing factor 4. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. PRP4 phosphorylates a number of factors involved in the formation of active spliceosomes, which catalyze pre-mRNA splicing. It phosphorylates PRP6 and PRP31, components of the U4/U6-U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), during spliceosomal complex formation. In fission yeast, PRP4 phosphorylates the splicing factor PRP1 (U5-102 kD in mammals). Thus, PRP4 plays a key role in regulating spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. It also plays an important role in mitosis by acting as a spindle assembly checkpoint kinase that is required for chromosome alignment and the recruitment of the checkpoint proteins MPS1, MAD1, and MAD2 at kinetochores. The PRP4 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.	318
271038	cd14136	STKc_SRPK	Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine Kinase, Serine-aRginine Protein Kinase. STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. SRPKs phosphorylate and regulate splicing factors from the SR protein family by specifically phosphorylating multiple serine residues residing in SR/RS dipeptide motifs (also known as RS domains). Phosphorylation of the RS domains enhances interaction with transportin SR and facilitates entry of the SR proteins into the nucleus. SRPKs contain a nonconserved insert domain, within the well-conserved catalytic kinase domain, that regulates their subcellular localization. They play important roles in mediating pre-mRNA processing and mRNA maturation, as well as other cellular functions such as chromatin reorganization, cell cycle and p53 regulation, and metabolic signaling. Vertebrates contain three distinct SRPKs, called SRPK1-3. The SRPK homolog in budding yeast, Sky1p, recognizes and phosphorylates its substrate Npl3p, which lacks a classic RS domain but contains a single RS dipeptide at the C-terminus of its RGG domain. Npl3p is a shuttling heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that exports a distinct class of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The SRPK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.	320

MK2 is a bonafide substrate for the MAPK p38. It is closely related to MK3 and thus far, MK2/3 show indistinguishable substrate specificity. They are mainly involved in the regulation of gene expression and they participate in diverse cellular processes such as endocytosis, cytokine production, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling. They are implicated in inflammation and cance and their substrates include mRNA-AU-rich-element (ARE)-binding proteins (TTP and hnRNP A0), Hsp proteins (Hsp27 and Hsp25) and RSK, among others. MK2/3 are both expressed ubiquitously but MK2 is expressed at significantly higher levels.

MAPK-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAP3 or MK3) contains an N-terminal proline-rich region that can bind to SH3 domains, a catalytic kinase domain followed by a C-terminal autoinhibitory region that contains nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export (NES) signals with a p38 MAPK docking motif that overlaps the NLS. MK3 is a bonafide substrate for the MAPK p38. It is closely related to MK2 and thus far, MK2/3 show indistinguishable substrate specificity. They are mainly involved in the regulation of gene expression and they participate in diverse cellular processes such as endocytosis, cytokine production, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling.

270469	cd14283	UBA_TNR6C	UBA domain found in trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6C protein (TNRC6C) and similar proteins. TNRC6C is one of three GW182 paralogs in mammalian genomes. It is enriched in P-bodies and important for efficient miRNA-mediated repression. TNRC6C is composed of an N-terminal glycine/tryptophan (G/W)-rich region containing an Ago hook responsible for Ago protein-binding; a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a glutamine (Q)-rich region in the middle region; a middle G/W-rich region, a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also called RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal G/W-rich region, at the C-terminus. A bipartite C-terminal region including the middle and C-terminal G/W-rich regions is referred as silencing domain that triggers silencing of bound transcripts by inhibiting protein expression and promoting mRNA decay via deadenylation. The C-terminal half containing the RRM domain functions as a key effector domain mediating protein synthesis repression by TNRC6C.	38
270470	cd14284	UBA_GAWKY	UBA domain found in Drosophila melanogaster protein Gawky (GW) and similar proteins. GW is the D. melanogaster GW182 homolog (dGW182) which belongs to the GW182 protein family. The GW182 proteins directly interact with Argonaute (Ago) proteins, and thus function as downstream effectors in the miRNA pathway, responsible for inhibition of translation and acceleration of mRNA decay. They are characterized by an abnormally high content of glycine/tryptophan (G/W) repeats, one or more glutamine (Q)-rich motifs, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also called RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The GW182 proteins are recruited to miRNA targets through an interaction between their N-terminal domain and an Argonaute protein. Then they promote translational repression and/or degradation of miRNA targets through their C-terminal silencing domain. In addition to a G/W repeats region, a Q-rich region, and a RRM domain, GW also contains a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA).	35

The family contains a DBHS domain (for Drosophila behavior, human splicing), which comprises two conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a charged protein-protein interaction NOPS (NONA and PSP1) domain. This model corresponds to the NOPS domain, with a long helical C-terminal extension, of paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1, also termed PSP1), a novel nucleolar factor that accumulates within a new nucleoplasmic compartment, termed paraspeckles, and diffusely distributes in the nucleoplasm. It is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved in vertebrates. Although its cellular function remains unknown currently, PSPC1 forms a novel heterodimer with the nuclear protein p54nrb, also known as non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), which localizes to paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent manner. The NOPS domain specifically binds to the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) domain of the partner DBHS protein via a substantial interaction surface. Its highly conserved C-terminal residues are critical for functional DBHS dimerization while the highly conserved C-terminal helical extension, forming a right-handed antiparallel heterodimeric coiled-coil, is essential for localization of these proteins to subnuclear bodies.	0
271762	cl14879	LabA_like_C	C-terminal domain of LabA_like proteins. A predicted RNA-binding domain found in insect Oskar and vertebrate TDRD5/TDRD7 proteins that nucleate or organize structurally related ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, the polar granule and nuage, is poorly understood. The domain adopts the winged helix-turn- helix fold and bind RNA with a potential specificity for dsRNA.In eukaryotes this domain is often combined in the same polypeptide with protein-protein- or lipid- interaction domains that might play a role in anchoring these proteins to specific cytoskeletal structures. Thus, proteins with this domain might have a key role in the recognition and localization of dsRNA, including miRNAs, rasiRNAs and piRNAs hybridized to their targets. In other cases, this domain is fused to ubiquitin-binding, E3 ligase and ubiquitin-like domains indicating a previously under-appreciated role for ubiquitination in regulating the assembly and stability of nuage-like RNP complexes.

250608	pfam01423	LSM	LSM domain. The LSM domain contains Sm proteins as well as other related LSM (Like Sm) proteins. The U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing contain seven Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F and G) in common, which assemble around the Sm site present in four of the major spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs. The U6 snRNP binds to the LSM (Like Sm) proteins. Sm proteins are also found in archaebacteria, which do not have any splicing apparatus suggesting a more general role for Sm proteins. All Sm proteins contain a common sequence motif in two segments, Sm1 and Sm2, separated by a short variable linker. This family also includes the bacterial Hfq (host factor Q) proteins.

The U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) is required for three cleavage events that generate the mature 18S rRNA from the pre-rRNA. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, depletion of Mpp10, a U3 snoRNP-specific protein, halts 18S rRNA production and impairs cleavage at the three U3 snoRNP-dependent sites.	613
112836	pfam04037	DUF382	Domain of unknown function (DUF382). This domain is specific to the human splicing factor 3b subunit 2 and it's orthologues. Splicing factor 3b subunit 2 or SAP145 is a suppressor of U2 snRNA mutations. Pre-mRNA splicing is catalysed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. Spliceosomes are multi-component enzymes that catalyse pre-mRNA splicing and form step-wise by the ordered interaction of UsnRNPs and non-snRNP proteins with short conserved regions of the pre-mRNA at the 5' and 3' splice sites and branch site.	129
252401	pfam04135	Nop10p	Nucleolar RNA-binding protein, Nop10p family. Nop10p is a nucleolar protein that is specifically associated with H/ACA snoRNAs.

This region is necessary and sufficient for normal cell growth, and specifically binds two snoRNAs snR10 and snR30. This region is also necessary for nucleolar targeting, and it is thought that the protein is co-transported to the nucleolus as part of a nucleoprotein complex. In humans, Gar1 is also component of telomerase in vivo. Naf1 is an essentail protein that plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, modification of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and telomere synthesis, and is homologous to Gar1.	154

The Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein, the product of the spinal muscular atrophy-determining gene, is part of a large macromolecular complex (SMN complex) that functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The SMN complex functions as a specificity factor essential for the efficient assembly of Sm proteins on U snRNAs and likely protects cells from illicit, and potentially deleterious, non-specific binding of Sm proteins to RNAs.	264
114912	pfam06220	zf-U1	U1 zinc finger. This family consists of several U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1-C) proteins. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5' splice site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5' ss is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5' ss. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5' ss helps to stabilize U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator. This domain is probably a zinc-binding. It is found in multiple copies in some members of the family.	38

This family consists of several eukaryotic splicing factor 3B subunit 1 proteins, which associate with p14 through a C-terminus beta-strand that interacts with beta-3 of the p14 RNA recognition motif (RRM) beta-sheet, which is in turn connected to an alpha-helix by a loop that makes extensive contacts with both the shorter C-terminal helix and RRM of p14. This subunit is required for 'A' splicing complex assembly (formed by the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA) and 'E' splicing complex assembly.	142

256080	pfam10596	U6-snRNA_bdg	U6-snRNA interacting domain of PrP8. This domain incorporates the interacting site for the U6-snRNA as part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs complex of the spliceosome, and is the prime candidate for the role of cofactor for the spliceosome's RNA core. The essential spliceosomal protein Prp8 interacts with U5 and U6 snRNAs and with specific pre-mRNA sequences that participate in catalysis. This close association with crucial RNA sequences, together with extensive genetic evidence, suggests that Prp8 could directly affect the function of the catalytic core, perhaps acting as a splicing cofactor.	160
192639	pfam10598	RRM_4	RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8. The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is PrP8 which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences. Recognition of RNA targets can also be modulated by a number of other factors, most notably the two loops beta1-alpha1, beta2-beta3 and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the RNP2 domain.	94

The domain adopts the winged helix-turn- helix fold and bind RNA with a potential specificity for dsRNA.In eukaryotes this domain is often combined in the same polypeptide with protein-protein- or lipid- interaction domains that might play a role in anchoring these proteins to specific cytoskeletal structures. Thus, proteins with this domain might have a key role in the recognition and localization of dsRNA, including miRNAs, rasiRNAs and piRNAs hybridized to their targets. In other cases, this domain is fused to ubiquitin-binding, E3 ligase and ubiquitin-like domains indicating a previously under-appreciated role for ubiquitination in regulating the assembly and stability of nuage-like RNP complexes. Both bacteria and eukaryotes encode a conserved family of proteins that combines this predicted RNA-binding domain with a previously uncharacterized RNAse domain belonging to the superfamily that includes the 5'->3' nucleases, PIN and NYN domains.	74
