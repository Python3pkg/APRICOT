IPR004087	SM00322	K Homology domain	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. An evolutionarily conserved sequence of around 70 amino acids, the KH domain is present in a wide variety of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The KH domain binds RNA, and can function in RNA recognition. It is found in multiple copies in several proteins, where they can function cooperatively or independently. For example, in the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP, which has 4 KH domains, KH domains 3 and 4 behave as independent binding modules to interact with different regions of the AU-rich RNA targets. The solution structure of the first KH domain of FMR1 and of the C-terminal KH domain of hnRNP K determined by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) revealed a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure. Proteins containing KH domains include:Bacterial and organelle PNPases.Archaeal and eukaryotic exosome subunits.Eukaryotic and prokaryotic RS3 ribosomal proteins.Vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1).Vigilin, which has 14 KH domains.AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP.hnRNP K, which contains 3 KH domains.Human onconeural ventral antigen-1 (NOVA-1).According to structural analyses the KH domain can be separated in two groups - type 1 and type 2.

IPR004088	PDOC50084	K Homology domain, type 1	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2. Proteins known to contain a type-1 KH domain include bacterial polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferases ; vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1); eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), one of at least 20 major proteins that are part of hnRNP particles in mammalian cells; mammalian poly(rC) binding proteins; Artemia salina glycine-rich protein GRP33; yeast PAB1-binding protein 2 (PBP2); vertebrate vigilin; and human high-density lipoprotein binding protein (HDL-binding protein).
