This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of PUF60, also termed FUSE-binding protein-interacting repressor (FBP-interacting repressor or FIR), or Ro-binding protein 1 (RoBP1), or Siah-binding protein 1 (Siah-BP1), an essential splicing factor that functions as a poly-U RNA-binding protein required to reconstitute splicing in depleted nuclear extracts. Its function is enhanced through interaction with U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65. PUF60 also controls human c-myc gene expression by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor far upstream sequence element (FUSE)-binding-protein (FBP), an activator of c-myc promoters.

SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), and is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 generally contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily. However, the EK domain is unique to SREK1, plays a modulatory role controlling SR domain function by involvement in the inhibition of both constitutive and alternative splicing and in the selection of splice-site.

CELF-1 is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. Human CELF-1 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing, with implications for onset of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), a neuromuscular disease associated with an unstable CUG triplet expansion in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene, it preferentially targets UGU-rich mRNA elements. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It binds specifically to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contains three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity, it preferentially binds to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. It also binds to the 3'-UTR of cyclooxygenase-2 messages, affecting both translation and mRNA stability, and binds to apoB mRNA, regulating its C to U editing. CELF-2 also contains three highly conserved RRMs. It binds to RNA via the first two RRMs, which are also important for localization in the cytoplasm. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-2 on some specific substrates is mediated by RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-2, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion.

RBFOX2 activates splicing of neuron-specific exons through binding to downstream UGCAUG elements. RBFOX2 also functions as a repressor of tamoxifen activation of the estrogen receptor. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 3 (RBFOX3 or NeuN or HRNBP3), also termed Fox-1 homolog C, is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of the RBFOX2 pre-mRNA, producing a message encoding a dominant negative form of the RBFOX2 protein. Its message is detected exclusively in post-mitotic regions of embryonic brain. Like RBFOX1, both RBFOX2 and RBFOX3 bind to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG elements and modulate brain and muscle-specific splicing of exon EIIIB of fibronectin, exon N1 of c-src, and calcitonin/CGRP.

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of G3BP1, also termed ATP-dependent DNA helicase VIII (DH VIII), or GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1, which has been identified as a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease that interacts with the SH3 domain of RasGAP, a multi-functional protein controlling Ras activity. The acidic RasGAP binding domain of G3BP1 harbors an arsenite-regulated phosphorylation site and dominantly inhibits stress granule (SG) formation. G3BP1 also contains an N-terminal nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM domain), and an Arg-Gly-rich region (RGG-rich region, or arginine methylation motif). The RRM domain and RGG-rich region are canonically associated with RNA binding. G3BP1 co-immunoprecipitates with mRNAs. It binds to and cleaves the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the c-myc mRNA in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thus, G3BP1 may play a role in coupling extra-cellular stimuli to mRNA stability. It has been shown that G3BP1 is a novel Dishevelled-associated protein that is methylated upon Wnt3a stimulation and that arginine methylation of G3BP1 regulates both Ctnnb1 mRNA and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Furthermore, G3BP1 can be associated with the 3'-UTR of beta-F1 mRNA in cytoplasmic RNA-granules, demonstrating that G3BP1 may specifically repress the translation of the transcript.	NA	80	RRM
240750	cd12304	RRM_Set1	RNA recognition motif in the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases which includes Set1A and Set1B that are ubiquitously expressed vertebrates histone methyltransferases exhibiting high homology to yeast Set1. Set1A and Set1B proteins exhibit a largely non-overlapping subnuclear distribution in euchromatic nuclear speckles, strongly suggesting that they bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. With the exception of the catalytic component, the subunit composition of the Set1A and Set1B histone methyltransferase complexes are identical. Each complex contains six human homologs of the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex, including Set1A or Set1B, Ash2 (homologous to yeast Bre2), CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1, homologous to yeast Spp1), Rbbp5 (homologous to yeast Swd1), Wdr5 (homologous to yeast Swd3), and Wdr82 (homologous to yeast Swd2). The genomic targeting of these complexes is determined by the identity of the catalytic subunit present in each histone methyltransferase complex. Thus, the Set1A and Set1B complexes may exhibit both overlapping and non-redundant properties. Both Set1A and Set1B contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), an N- SET domain, and a C-terminal catalytic SET domain followed by a post-SET domain.

BOULE is the founder member of the family and DAZL arose from BOULE in an ancestor of vertebrates. The DAZ gene subsequently originated from a duplication transposition of the DAZL gene. Invertebrates contain a single DAZ homolog, BOULE, while vertebrates, other than catarrhine primates, possess both BOULE and DAZL genes. The catarrhine primates possess BOULE, DAZL, and DAZ genes. The family members encode closely related RNA-binding proteins that are required for fertility in numerous organisms. These proteins contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a varying number of copies of a DAZ motif, believed to mediate protein-protein interactions. DAZL and BOULE contain a single copy of the DAZ motif, while DAZ proteins can contain 8-24 copies of this repeat. Although their specific biochemical functions remain to be investigated, DAZL proteins may interact with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs), and act as translational activators of specific mRNAs during gametogenesis.

It also functions as an important negative regulator for the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta/activin/Nodal signaling pathway by directly interacting with chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional regulators, including the R-Smads, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. Moreover, Man1 is a unique type of left-right (LR) signaling regulator that acts on the inner nuclear membrane. Man1 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. The vascular remodeling can be regulated at the inner nuclear membrane through the interaction between Man1 and Smads. Man1 contains an N-terminal LEM domain, two putative transmembrane domains, a MAN1-Src1p C-terminal (MSC) domain, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The LEM domain interacts with the DNA and chromatin-binding protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor, and is also necessary for efficient localization of MAN1 in the inner nuclear membrane. Research has indicated that C-terminal nucleoplasmic region of Man1 exhibits a DNA binding winged helix domain and is responsible for both DNA- and Smad-binding.	NA	92	RRM

They localize to nucleoli, suggesting roles in ribosomal RNA production, but RH-II/Gubeta also localizes to nuclear speckles containing the splicing factor SC35, suggesting its possible involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In contrast to RH-II/Gualpha, RH-II/Gubeta has RNA-unwinding activity, but no RNA-folding activity. The family also contains plant DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 7 (RH7 or PRH75), Thermus thermophilus heat resistant RNA-dependent ATPase (Hera) and similar proteins.

CELF-1 is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. Human CELF-1 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing, with implications for onset of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), a neuromuscular disease associated with an unstable CUG triplet expansion in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene, it preferentially targets UGU-rich mRNA elements. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It specifically binds to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity, it binds preferentially to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. It also binds to the 3'-UTR of cyclooxygenase-2 messages, affecting both translation and mRNA stability, and binds to apoB mRNA, regulating its C to U editing. CELF-2 also contain three highly conserved RRMs. It binds to RNA via the first two RRMs, which are important for localization in the cytoplasm. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-2 on some specific substrates is mediated by RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-2, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. In addition, CELF-2 possesses a typical arginine and lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus, within RRM3.	NA	92	RRM

On the other hand, both RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-4 can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. CELF-5, expressed in brain, is also known as bruno-like protein 5 (BRUNOL-5), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 5.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the family including yeast cell wall integrity protein scw1, yeast Whi3 protein, yeast Whi4 protein and similar proteins. The strong cell wall protein 1, scw1, is a nonessential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates septation and cell-wall structure in fission yeast. It may function as an inhibitor of septum formation, such that its loss of function allows weak SIN signaling to promote septum formation. It's RRM domain shows high homology to two budding yeast proteins, Whi3 and Whi4. Whi3 is a dose-dependent modulator of cell size and has been implicated in cell cycle control in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It functions as a negative regulator of ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal 3 (Cln3), a G1 cyclin that promotes transcription of many genes to trigger the G1/S transition in budding yeast. It specifically binds the CLN3 mRNA and localizes it into discrete cytoplasmic loci that may locally restrict Cln3 synthesis to modulate cell cycle progression. Moreover, Whi3 plays a key role in cell fate determination in budding yeast. The RRM domain is essential for Whi3 function. Whi4 is a partially redundant homolog of Whi3, also containing one RRM.

SRSF10 is a serine-arginine (SR) protein that acts as a potent and general splicing repressor when dephosphorylated. It mediates global inhibition of splicing both in M phase of the cell cycle and in response to heat shock. SRSF10 emerges as a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) splicing efficiency. It also regulates cardiac-specific alternative splicing of triadin pre-mRNA and is required for proper Ca2+ handling during embryonic heart development. In contrast, the phosphorylated SRSF10 functions as a sequence-specific splicing activator in the presence of a nuclear cofactor. It activates distal alternative 5' splice site of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo. Moreover, SRSF10 strengthens pre-mRNA recognition by U1 and U2 snRNPs. SRSF10 localizes to the nuclear speckles and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of eIF-4H, also termed Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 1 protein, which, together with elf-4B/eIF-4G, serves as the accessory protein of RNA helicase eIF-4A. eIF-4H contains a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

SRSF12 is a serine/arginine (SR) protein-like alternative splicing regulator that antagonizes authentic SR proteins in the modulation of alternative 5' splice site choice. For instance, it activates distal alternative 5' splice site of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of SLTM, also termed modulator of estrogen-induced transcription, which shares high sequence similarity with scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1). It contains a scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain) DNA-binding motif, an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region rich in glutamine and arginine residues. To a large extent, SLTM co-localizes with SAFB1 in the nucleus, which suggests that they share similar functions, such as the inhibition of an oestrogen reporter gene. However, rather than mediating a specific inhibitory effect on oestrogen action, SLTM is shown to exert a generalized inhibitory effect on gene expression associated with induction of apoptosis in a wide range of cell lines.

It may also interact with a group of nucleoporins including Nup93, Nup155, and Nup205 and play a role in the association of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad1 with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Nup35 contains an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix and several FG repeats. This RRM lacks the conserved residues that typically bind RNA in canonical RRM domains.	NA	74	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two serine/arginine (SR) proteins, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (SRSF7). SRSF3, also termed pre-mRNA-splicing factor SRp20, modulates alternative splicing by interacting with RNA cis-elements in a concentration- and cell differentiation-dependent manner. It is also involved in termination of transcription, alternative RNA polyadenylation, RNA export, and protein translation. SRSF3 is critical for cell proliferation, and tumor induction and maintenance. It can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. SRSF7, also termed splicing factor 9G8, plays a crucial role in both constitutive splicing and alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs. Its localization and functions are tightly regulated by phosphorylation. SRSF7 is predominantly present in the nuclear and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. It cooperates with the export protein, Tap/NXF1, helps mRNA export to the cytoplasm, and enhances the expression of unspliced mRNA. Moreover, SRSF7 inhibits tau E10 inclusion through directly interacting with the proximal downstream intron of E10, a clustering region for frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP) mutations. Both SRSF3 and SRSF7 contain a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides.

277559	cl21719	Pumilio	Pumilio-family RNA binding domain. Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. S. cerevisiae JSN1, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences, some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SRSF11, also termed arginine-rich 54 kDa nuclear protein (SRp54 or p54), which belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family). It is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. SRSF11 has been identified as a tau exon 10 splicing repressor. It interacts with a purine-rich element in exon 10, and suppresses exon 10 inclusion by antagonizing Tra2beta, an SR-domain-containing protein that enhances exon 10 inclusion. SRSF11 is a unique SR family member and may regulate the alternative splicing in a tissue- and substrate-dependent manner. It can directly interact with the U2 auxiliary factor 65-kDa subunit (U2AF65), a protein associated with the 3' splice site. In addition, unlike the typical SR proteins, SRSF11 associates with other SR proteins but not with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1-70K or the U2 auxiliary factor 35-kDa subunit (U2AF35). SREK1 has unique properties in regulating alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs, it promotes the use of the distal 5' splice site in E1A pre-mRNA alternative splicing. It also inhibits cryptic splice site selection on the beta-globin pre-mRNA containing competing 5' splice sites.

SPF45 is an RNA-binding protein consisting of an unstructured N-terminal region, followed by a G-patch motif and a C-terminal U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor) homology motifs (UHM) that harbors a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain) and an Arg-Xaa-Phe sequence motif. SPF45 regulates alternative splicing of the apoptosis regulatory gene FAS (also known as CD95). It induces exon 6 skipping in FAS pre-mRNA through the UHM domain that binds to tryptophan-containing linear peptide motifs (UHM ligand motifs, ULMs) present in the 3' splice site-recognizing factors U2AF65, SF1 and SF3b155. PUF60 is an essential splicing factor that functions as a poly-U RNA-binding protein required to reconstitute splicing in depleted nuclear extracts. Its function is enhanced through interaction with U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65. PUF60 also controls human c-myc gene expression by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor far upstream sequence element (FUSE)-binding-protein (FBP), an activator of c-myc promoters.

A bipartite C-terminal region including the middle and C-terminal G/W-rich regions is referred as silencing domain that triggers silencing of bound transcripts by inhibiting protein expression and promoting mRNA decay via deadenylation. The C-terminal half containing the RRM domain functions as a key effector domain mediating protein synthesis repression by TNRC6C.	NA	38	RRM

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) proteins, a family of structurally related RNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and in the control of mRNA translation and deadenylation in the cytoplasm. The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also termed BRUNOL-2, or CUG-BP1, or NAPOR, or EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also termed BRUNOL-3, or ETR-3, or CUG-BP2, or NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also termed BRUNOL-1, or TNRC4, or ETR-1, or CAGH4, or ER DA4), CELF-4 (also termed BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (also termed BRUNOL-5), CELF-6 (also termed BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts.	NA	73	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM-like Smg4_UPF3 domain found in yeast up-frameshift suppressor 3 (Upf3p), Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4, their human orthologs Upf3A and Upf3B, and similar proteins. Upf3p, also termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay protein 3, or Sua6p, a surveillance factor encoded by UPF3 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in yeast. Upf3p is primarily cytoplasmic but accumulates inside the nucleus. Its nuclear import is mediated by the Srp1p (importin-alpha)/beta heterodimer while its nuclear export is mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES-A), but not the Crm1p exportin. C. elegans SMG-4 is a nuclear shuttling protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus through nuclear import and export signals similar to that of the yeast Upf3p. It is regulated by phosphorylation. Human orthologs of yeast Upf3p and C. elegans SMG-4 include Upf3A and Upf3B, which derive from two genes, UPF3A and X-linked UPF3B, respectively. Both, Upf3A (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog A, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3A, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3A) and Upf3B (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog B on chromosome X, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3B, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3B), are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. They associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any human Upf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA prevents NMD. The function of the Upf proteins in identifying and targeting nonsense mRNAs for rapid decay is conserved among eukaryotes. Besides, all Upf proteins in this family contain a conserved Smg4_UPF3 domain with some similarity to an RNA recognition motif (RRM), indicating that they may be RNA binding proteins.	NA	88	RRM

RNPS1, also termed RNA-binding protein prevalent during the S phase, or SR-related protein LDC2, was originally characterized as a general pre-mRNA splicing activator, which activates both constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in vitro.It has been identified as a protein component of the splicing-dependent mRNP complex, or exon-exon junction complex (EJC), and is directly involved in mRNA surveillance. Furthermore, RNPS1 is a splicing regulator whose activator function is controlled in part by CK2 (casein kinase II) protein kinase phosphorylation. It can also function as a squamous-cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells-3 (SART3)-binding protein, and is involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing. RNPS1 contains an N-terminal serine-rich (S) domain, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and the C-terminal arginine/serine/proline-rich (RS/P) domain.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in a new class of SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors), including SCAF4, SCAF8 and similar proteins. The biological role of SCAF4 remains unclear, but it shows high sequence similarity to SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8). SCAF8 is a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. In addition, SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF8 and SCAF4 both contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.

It mediates transcriptional coactivation and RNA splicing effects in a promoter-preferential manner and is enhanced by thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein (TRBP). CoAA contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a TRBP-interacting domain. It stimulates transcription through its interactions with coactivators, such as TRBP and CREB-binding protein CBP/p300, via the TRBP-interacting domain and interaction with an RNA-containing complex, such as DNA-dependent protein kinase-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase complexes, via the RRMs.	NA	69	RRM

Although it belongs to the well-characterized poly(A) polymerase protein superfamily, Star-PAP is highly divergent from both, the poly(A) polymerase (PAP) and the terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase), identified within the editing complexes of trypanosomes. Star-PAP predominantly localizes at nuclear speckles and catalyzes RNA-modifying nucleotidyl transferase reactions. It functions in mRNA biosynthesis and may be regulated by phosphoinositides. It binds to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PIPKIalpha. Star-PAP preferentially uses ATP as a nucleotide substrate and possesses PAP activity that is stimulated by PtdIns4,5P2.

Additional research indicates U2B" binds to U1 snRNA stem-loop II (SLII) as well and shows no preference for SLIV or SLII on the basis of binding affinity. U2B" does not require an auxiliary protein for binding to RNA and its nuclear transport is independent of U2 snRNA binding. U2B" contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). It also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the central domain. However, nuclear import of U2B'' does not depend on this NLS. The N-terminal RRM is sufficient to direct U2B" to the nucleus.	NA	80	RRM

ZCRB1 is one of the components of U11/U12 snRNPs that bind to U12-type pre-mRNAs and form a di-snRNP complex, simultaneously recognizing the 5' splice site and branchpoint sequence. ZCRB1 is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a CCHC-type Zinc finger motif.

The family represents type I polyadenylate-binding proteins (PABPs), including polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP-1 or PABPC1), polyadenylate-binding protein 3 (PABP-3 or PABPC3), polyadenylate-binding protein 4 (PABP-4 or APP-1 or iPABP), polyadenylate-binding protein 5 (PABP-5 or PABPC5), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like (PABP-1-like or PABPC1L), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like 2 (PABPC1L2 or RBM32), polyadenylate-binding protein 4-like (PABP-4-like or PABPC4L), yeast polyadenylate-binding protein, cytoplasmic and nuclear (PABP or ACBP-67), and similar proteins. PABP-1 is an ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that may play a role in 3' end formation of mRNA, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization, protection of poly(A) from nuclease activity, mRNA deadenylation, inhibition of mRNA decapping, and mRNP maturation. Although PABP-1 is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, it is also found in the nucleus. PABP-1 may be involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and utilization of mRNP particles. PABP-1 contains four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), a less well conserved linker region, and a proline-rich C-terminal conserved domain (CTD). PABP-3 is a testis-specific poly(A)-binding protein specifically expressed in round spermatids. It is mainly found in mammalian and may play an important role in the testis-specific regulation of mRNA homeostasis. PABP-3 shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1. However, it binds to poly(A) with a lower affinity than PABP-1. Moreover, PABP-1 possesses an A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR and allows binding of PABP and blockage of translation of its own mRNA. In contrast, PABP-3 lacks the A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR. PABP-4 is an inducible poly(A)-binding protein (iPABP) that is primarily localized to the cytoplasm. It shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1 as well. The RNA binding properties of PABP-1 and PABP-4 appear to be identical. PABP-5 is encoded by PABPC5 gene within the X-specific subinterval, and expressed in fetal brain and in a range of adult tissues in mammalian, such as ovary and testis. It may play an important role in germ cell development. Moreover, unlike other PABPs, PABP-5 contains only four RRMs, but lacks both the linker region and the CTD. PABP-1-like and PABP-1-like 2 are the orthologs of PABP-1. PABP-4-like is the ortholog of PABP-5. Their cellular functions remain unclear. The family also includes the yeast PABP, a conserved poly(A) binding protein containing poly(A) tails that can be attached to the 3'-ends of mRNAs. The yeast PABP and its homologs may play important roles in the initiation of translation and in mRNA decay. Like vertebrate PABP-1, the yeast PABP contains four RRMs, a linker region, and a proline-rich CTD as well. The first two RRMs are mainly responsible for specific binding to poly(A). The proline-rich region may be involved in protein-protein interactions.	NA	79	RRM

Their corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The C-terminal RRM (RRM3) is unique to Mei2-like proteins and it is highly conserved between plants and fungi.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM3 of U2AF65 and dU2AF50. U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies.

The family also includes Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup53p, an ortholog of vertebrate nucleoporin Nup53. A unique property of yeast Nup53p is that it contains an additional Kap121p-binding domain and interacts specifically with the karyopherin Kap121p, which is involved in the assembly of Nup53p into NPCs. Both, vertebrate Nup35 and yeast Nup53p, contain an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix and several FG repeats.

The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences.

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. Rod1 is a mammalian polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It might play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. hnRNP-L is a higher eukaryotic specific subunit of human KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) complex required for histone H3 Lys-36 trimethylation activity. It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells.

It mediates global inhibition of splicing both in M phase of the cell cycle and in response to heat shock. SRSF10 emerges as a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) splicing efficiency. It also regulates cardiac-specific alternative splicing of triadin pre-mRNA and is required for proper Ca2+ handling during embryonic heart development. In contrast, the phosphorylated SRSF10 functions as a sequence-specific splicing activator in the presence of a nuclear cofactor. It activates distal alternative 5' splice site of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo. Moreover, SRSF10 strengthens pre-mRNA recognition by U1 and U2 snRNPs.

RRM usually interacts with ssRNA, but is also known to interact with ssDNA as well as proteins. RRM binds a variable number of nucleotides, ranging from two to eight. The active site includes three aromatic side-chains located within the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs of the domain. The RRM domain is found in a variety heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and functions at several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein and negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals.

U1-70K plays an essential role in targeting the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site through protein-protein interactions with regulatory RNA-binding splicing factors, such as the RS protein ASF/SF2. Moreover, U1-70K protein can specifically bind to stem-loop I of the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) contained in the U1 snRNP complex. It also mediates the binding of U1C, another U1-specific protein, to the U1 snRNP complex. U1-70K contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by an adjacent glycine-rich region at the N-terminal half, and two serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains at the C-terminal half. The RRM is responsible for the binding of stem-loop I of U1 snRNA molecule. Additionally, the most prominent immunodominant region that can be recognized by auto-antibodies from autoimmune patients may be located within the RRM. The SR domains are involved in protein-protein interaction with SR proteins that mediate 5' splice site recognition. For instance, the first SR domain is necessary and sufficient for ASF/SF2 Binding. The family also includes Drosophila U1-70K that is an essential splicing factor required for viability in flies, but its SR domain is dispensable. The yeast U1-70k doesn't contain easily recognizable SR domains and shows low sequence similarity in the RRM region with other U1-70k proteins and therefore not included in this family. The RRM domain is dispensable for yeast U1-70K function.	NA	91	RRM

Synaptojanin-1 contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the cytoplasmic portion of the yeast protein Sac1p, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich region mediating the binding of synaptojanin-1 to various SH3 domain-containing proteins including amphiphysin, SH3p4, SH3p8, SH3p13, and Grb2. Synaptojanin-1 has two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, synaptojanin-145 expressed in brain and synaptojanin-170 expressed in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-145 is very abundant in nerve terminals and may play an essential role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. In contrast to synaptojanin-145, synaptojanin-170 contains three unique asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motifs in the C-terminal region and may functions as a potential binding partner for Eps15, a clathrin coat-associated protein acting as a major substrate for the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor.

It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It binds specifically to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity, it binds preferentially to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs.

It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	80	KH

PUF60 also controls human c-myc gene expression by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor far upstream sequence element (FUSE)-binding-protein (FBP), an activator of c-myc promoters. PUF60 contains two central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a C-terminal U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor) homology motifs (UHM) that harbors another RRM and binds to tryptophan-containing linear peptide motifs (UHM ligand motifs, ULMs) in several nuclear proteins. Research indicates that PUF60 binds FUSE as a dimer, and only the first two RRM domains participate in the single-stranded DNA recognition.	NA	76	RRM

CoAA contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a TRBP-interacting domain. RBM4 is a ubiquitously expressed splicing factor with two isoforms, RBM4A (also known as Lark homolog) and RBM4B (also known as RBM30), which are very similar in structure and sequence. RBM4 may also function as a translational regulator of stress-associated mRNAs as well as play a role in micro-RNA-mediated gene regulation. RBM4 contains two N-terminal RRMs, a CCHC-type zinc finger, and three alanine-rich regions within their C-terminal regions. This family also includes Drosophila RNA-binding protein lark (Dlark), a homolog of human RBM4. It plays an important role in embryonic development and in the circadian regulation of adult eclosion. Dlark shares high sequence similarity with RBM4 at the N-terminal region. However, Dlark has three proline-rich segments instead of three alanine-rich segments within the C-terminal region.	NA	66	RRM

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of RCAN1, also termed calcipressin-1, or Adapt78, or Down syndrome critical region protein 1, or myocyte-enriched calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1), encoded by the Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1) gene that is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart and muscles. Overexpressed RCAN1 functions as an inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (also termed PP2B or PP3C), and is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS). RCAN1 can be phosphorylated by several kinases such as big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK), and protein kinase A (PKA). The phosphorylation of RCAN1 can positively or negatively regulate calcineurin-mediated gene transcription, and also affect its protein stability in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. RCAN1 consists of an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a highly conserved SP repeat domain containing the phosphorylation site by GSK-3, a well-known PxIxIT motif responsible for docking many substrates to calcineurin, and an unrecognized C-terminal TxxP motif of unknown function.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals.

240844	cd12398	RRM_CSTF2_RNA15_like	RNA recognition motif in cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2), yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. The family also includes yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. RNA15 is a core subunit of cleavage factor IA (CFIA), an essential transcriptional 3'-end processing factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RNA recognition by CFIA is mediated by an N-terminal RRM, which is contained in the RNA15 subunit of the complex. The RRM of RNA15 has a strong preference for GU-rich RNAs, mediated by a binding pocket that is entirely conserved in both yeast and vertebrate RNA15 orthologs.	NA	75	RRM

B. subtilis YxiN is a member of the DbpA subfamily of prokaryotic DEAD-box rRNA helicases that have been implicated in ribosome biogenesis. It binds with high affinity and specificity to RNA substrates containing hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA (HP92) with either 3' or 5' extensions in an ATP-dependent manner. YxiN contains two N-terminal ATPase catalytic domains and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain). The catalytic domains bind to nearby regions of RNA to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and disrupt RNA structures. The C-terminal domain is responsible for the high-affinity RNA binding.	NA	73	RRM
240922	cd12478	RRM1_U2B	RNA recognition motif 1 in U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein B" (U2B") and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of U2B" (also termed U2 snRNP B") a unique protein that comprises the U2 snRNP. It was initially identified as binding to stem-loop IV (SLIV) at the 3' end of U2 snRNA. Additional research indicates U2B" binds to U1 snRNA stem-loop II (SLII) as well and shows no preference for SLIV or SLII on the basis of binding affinity. U2B" does not require an auxiliary protein for binding to RNA. In addition, the nuclear transport of U2B" is independent of U2 snRNA binding. U2B" contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). It also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the central domain. However, nuclear import of U2B'' does not depend on this NLS. The N-terminal RRM is sufficient to direct U2B" to the nucleus.	NA	91	RRM

Splicing factor 1 (SF1) specifically recognizes the intron branch point sequence (BPS) UACUAAC in the pre-mRNA transcripts during spliceosome assembly. We show that the KH-QUA2 region of SF1 defines an enlarged KH (hnRNP K) fold which is necessary and sufficient for BPS binding. KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of hnRNP G, also termed glycoprotein p43 or RBMX, an RNA-binding motif protein located on the X chromosome. It is expressed ubiquitously and has been implicated in the splicing control of several pre-mRNAs. Moreover, hnRNP G may function as a regulator of transcription for SREBP-1c and GnRH1. Research has shown that hnRNP G may also act as a tumor-suppressor since it upregulates the Txnip gene and promotes the fidelity of DNA end-joining activity. In addition, hnRNP G appears to play a critical role in proper neural development of zebrafish and frog embryos. The family also includes several paralogs of hnRNP G, such as hRBMY and hnRNP G-T (also termed RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked-like-2). Both, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T, are exclusively expressed in testis and critical for male fertility. Like hnRNP G, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T interact with factors implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, such as hTra2-beta1 and T-STAR. Although members in this family share a high conserved N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), they appear to recognize different RNA targets. For instance, hRBMY interacts specifically with a stem-loop structure in which the loop is formed by the sequence CA/UCAA. In contrast, hnRNP G associates with single stranded RNA sequences containing a CCA/C motif. In addition to the RRM, hnRNP G contains a nascent transcripts targeting domain (NTD) in the middle region and a novel auxiliary RNA-binding domain (RBD) in its C-terminal region. The C-terminal RBD exhibits distinct RNA binding specificity, and would play a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing by hnRNP G.	NA	80	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of SRSF11 (SRp54 or p54), SREK1 ( SFRS12 or SRrp86) and similar proteins, a group of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR protein family). These are involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. SR proteins have been identified as crucial regulators of alternative splicing. Different SR proteins display different substrate specificity, have distinct functions in alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs, and can even negatively regulate splicing. All SR family members are characterized by the presence of one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and the C-terminal regions rich in serine and arginine dipeptides (SR domains). The RRM domain is responsible for RNA binding and specificity in both alternative and constitutive splicing. In contrast, SR domains are thought to be protein-protein interaction domains that are often interchangeable.	NA	76	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of yeast protein Cwc2, also termed Complexed with CEF1 protein 2, or PRP19-associated complex protein 40 (Ntc40), or synthetic lethal with CLF1 protein 3, one of the components of the Prp19-associated complex [nineteen complex (NTC)] that can bind to RNA. NTC is composed of the scaffold protein Prp19 and a number of associated splicing factors, and plays a crucial role in intron removal during premature mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Cwc2 functions as an RNA-binding protein that can bind both small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and pre-mRNA in vitro. It interacts directly with the U6 snRNA to link the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing. In the N-terminal half, Cwc2 contains a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF domain), a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and an intervening loop, also termed RNA-binding loop or RB loop, between ZnF and RRM, all of which are necessary and sufficient for RNA binding. The ZnF is also responsible for mediating protein-protein interaction. The C-terminal flexible region of Cwc2 interacts with the WD40 domain of Prp19.	NA	78	RRM

It contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), with high homology to the corresponding motif of the mammalian U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65 or U2AF2). UHMK1 targets two key regulators of cell proliferation and migration, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 and the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin. It plays a critical role during vascular wound repair by preventing excessive vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration into the vascular lesion. Moreover, UHMK1 may control cell migration and neurite outgrowth by interacting with and phosphorylating the splicing factor SF1, thereby probably contributing to the control of protein expression. Furthermore, UHMK1 may be functionally related to microtubule dynamics and axon development. It localizes to RNA granules, interacts with three proteins found in RNA granules (KIF3A, NonO, and eEF1A), and further enhances the local translation. UHMK1 is highly expressed in regions of the brain implicated in schizophrenia and may play a role in susceptibility to schizophrenia.	NA	88	RRM
240973	cd12529	RRM2_MEI2_like	RNA recognition motif 2 in plant Mei2-like proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of Mei2-like proteins that represent an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins family. Their corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The C-terminal RRM (RRM3) is unique to Mei2-like proteins and is highly conserved between plants and fungi.

It is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear RNA-binding protein identified as a component of the spliceosome complex, as well as a component of the apobec-1 editosome. As an alternatively spliced version of NSAP, it acts as an interaction partner of a multifunctional protein required for viral replication, and is implicated in the regulation of specific mRNA transport. hnRNP Q has also been identified as SYNCRIP that is a dual functional protein participating in both viral RNA replication and translation. As a synaptotagmin-binding protein, hnRNP Q plays a putative role in organelle-based mRNA transport along the cytoskeleton. Moreover, hnRNP Q has been found in protein complexes involved in translationally coupled mRNA turnover and mRNA splicing. It functions as a wild-type survival motor neuron (SMN)-binding protein that may participate in pre-mRNA splicing and modulate mRNA transport along microtubuli. hnRNP Q contains an acidic auxiliary N-terminal region, followed by two well-defined and one degenerated RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a C-terminal RGG motif, hnRNP Q binds RNA through its RRM domains.

This subgroup corresponds to the conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) in ECTO-NOX proteins (also termed ENOX), comprising a family of plant and animal NAD(P)H oxidases exhibiting both, oxidative and protein disulfide isomerase-like, activities. They are growth-related and drive cell enlargement, and may play roles in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. ENOX proteins function as terminal oxidases of plasma membrane electron transport (PMET) through catalyzing electron transport from plasma membrane quinones to extracellular oxygen, forming water as a product. They are also hydroquinone oxidases that oxidize externally supplied NADH, hence NOX. ENOX proteins harbor a di-copper center that lack flavin. ENOX proteins display protein disulfide interchange activity that is also possessed by protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast to the classic protein disulfide isomerases, ENOX proteins lack the double CXXC motif. This family includes two ENOX proteins, ENOX1 and ENOX2. ENOX1, also termed candidate growth-related and time keeping constitutive hydroquinone [NADH] oxidase (cCNOX), or cell proliferation-inducing gene 38 protein, or Constitutive Ecto-NOX (cNOX), is the constitutively expressed cell surface NADH (ubiquinone) oxidase that is ubiquitous and refractory to drugs. ENOX2, also termed APK1 antigen, or cytosolic ovarian carcinoma antigen 1, or tumor-associated hydroquinone oxidase (tNOX), is a cancer-specific variant of ENOX1 and plays a key role in cell proliferation and tumor progression. In contrast to ENOX1, ENOX2 is drug-responsive and harbors a drug binding site to which the cancer-specific S-peptide tagged pan-ENOX2 recombinant (scFv) is directed. Moreover, ENOX2 is specifically inhibited by a variety of quinone site inhibitors that have anticancer activity and is unique to the surface of cancer cells.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of hnRNP R, which is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear RNA-binding protein that specifically binds mRNAs with a preference for poly(U) stretches.

The cold shock proteins can be induced after exposure to a moderate cold-shock and other cellular stresses such as UV radiation and hypoxia. CIRBP and RBM3 may function in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to different transcripts, thus allowing the cell to response rapidly to environmental signals. However, the kinetics and degree of cold induction are different between CIRBP and RBM3. Tissue distribution of their expression is different. CIRBP and RBM3 may be differentially regulated under physiological and stress conditions and may play distinct roles in cold responses of cells. CIRBP, also termed glycine-rich RNA-binding protein CIRP, is localized in the nucleus and mediates the cold-induced suppression of cell cycle progression. CIRBP also binds DNA and possibly serves as a chaperone that assists in the folding/unfolding, assembly/disassembly and transport of various proteins. RBM3 may enhance global protein synthesis and the formation of active polysomes while reducing the levels of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing microRNAs. RBM3 may also serve to prevent the loss of muscle mass by its ability to decrease cell death. Furthermore, RBM3 may be essential for cell proliferation and mitosis. Both, CIRBP and RBM3, contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), that is involved in RNA binding, and C-terminal glycine-rich domain (RGG motif) that probably enhances RNA-binding via protein-protein and/or protein-RNA interactions.

Disruption of NRD1 gene is lethal to yeast cells. Its N-terminal domain is sufficient for viability, which may facilitate interactions with RNA polymerase II where Nrd1 may function as an auxiliary factor. By contrast, the RRM, RE/RS domains, and P+Q domain are dispensable. Seb1 is an RNA-binding protein encoded by gene seb1 (for seven binding) from fission yeast S. pombe.

During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs.

They bind with high affinity and specificity to RNA substrates containing hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA (HP92), which is part of the ribosomal A-site. The majority of dbpA proteins contain two N-terminal ATPase catalytic domains and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain). The catalytic domains bind to nearby regions of RNA to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and disrupt RNA structures. The C-terminal domain is responsible for the high-affinity RNA binding. Several members of this family lack specificity for 23S rRNA. These proteins can generally be distinguished by a basic region that extends beyond the C-terminal domain.	NA	71	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 and RRM2 domains of the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) as well as plant flowering time control protein FCA. CELF, also termed BRUNOL (Bruno-like) proteins, is a family of structurally related RNA-binding proteins involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus, and control of mRNA translation and deadenylation in the cytoplasm. The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also known as BRUNOL-2, CUG-BP1, NAPOR, EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also known as BRUNOL-3, ETR-3, CUG-BP2, NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also known as BRUNOL-1, TNRC4, ETR-1, CAGH4, ER DA4), CELF-4 (BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (BRUNOL-5) and CELF-6 (BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both, sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts.

U1A binds with high affinity and specificity to stem-loop II (SLII) of U1 snRNA. It is predominantly a nuclear protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm independently of interactions with U1 snRNA. U1A may be involved in RNA 3'-end processing, specifically cleavage, splicing and polyadenylation, through interacting with a large number of non-snRNP proteins, including polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), polypyrimidine-tract binding protein-associated factor (PSF), and non-POU-domain-containing, octamer-binding (NONO), DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5 (DDX5). U1A also binds to a flavivirus NS5 protein and plays an important role in virus replication. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), the N-terminal RRM (RRM1) binds tightly and specifically to the U1 snRNA SLII and its own 3'-UTR, while in contrast, the C-terminal RRM (RRM2) does not appear to associate with any RNA and it may be free for binding other proteins.

SF3B14 associates directly with another SF3B subunit called SF3B155. It is also present in both U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes and may contribute to branch site positioning in both the major and minor spliceosome. Moreover, SF3B14 interacts directly with the pre-mRNA branch adenosine early in spliceosome assembly and within the fully assembled spliceosome.

SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), which is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and it may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 contains two (some contain only one) RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region.

They bind hnRNA tightly, suggesting a central role in the formation of the ubiquitous hnRNP complex, they are involved in the packaging of the hnRNA in the nucleus and in processing of pre-mRNA such as splicing and 3'-end formation. Raly, also termed autoantigen p542, is an RNA-binding protein that may play a critical role in embryonic development. The biological role of RALYL remains unclear.

Under nonstress conditions, RBM42 predominantly localizes within the nucleus and co-localizes with hnRNP K. Under stress conditions, hnRNP K and RBM42 form cytoplasmic foci where the SG marker TIAR localizes, and may play a role in the maintenance of cellular ATP level by protecting their target mRNAs.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Aly/REF family which includes THO complex subunit 4 (THOC4, also termed Aly/REF), S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (SKAR, also termed PDIP3 or PDIP46) and similar proteins. THOC4 is an mRNA transporter protein with a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). It is involved in RNA transportation from the nucleus, and was initially identified as a transcription coactivator of LEF-1 and AML-1 for the TCRalpha enhancer function. In addition, THOC4 specifically binds to rhesus (RH) promoter in erythroid, and might be a novel transcription cofactor for erythroid-specific genes. SKAR shows high sequence homology with THOC4 and possesses one RRM as well. SKAR is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus. It may be a critical player in the function of S6K1 in cell and organism growth control by binding the activated, hyperphosphorylated form of S6K1 but not S6K2. Furthermore, SKAR functions as a protein partner of the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase delta. In addition, SKAR may have particular importance in pancreatic beta cell size determination and insulin secretion.	NA	75	RRM

Based on the numerous functions, SAFB1 has been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis. SAFB1 specifically binds to AT-rich scaffold or matrix attachment region DNA elements (S/MAR DNA) by using its N-terminal scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain), a homeodomain-like DNA binding motif. The central region of SAFB1 is composed of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminus of SAFB1 contains Glu/Arg- and Gly-rich regions that might be involved in protein-protein interaction. Additional studies indicate that the C-terminal region contains a potent and transferable transcriptional repression domain. Another family member is SAFB2, a homolog of SAFB1. Both SAFB1 and SAFB2 are ubiquitously coexpressed and share very high sequence similarity, suggesting that they might function in a similar manner. However, unlike SAFB1, exclusively existing in the nucleus, SAFB2 is also present in the cytoplasm. The additional cytoplasmic localization of SAFB2 implies that it could play additional roles in the cytoplasmic compartment which are distinct from the nuclear functions shared with SAFB1.	NA	76	RRM

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation.

The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The C-terminal RRM (RRM3) is unique to Mei2-like proteins and is highly conserved between plants and fungi.

SRSF2, also termed protein PR264, or splicing component, 35 kDa (splicing factor SC35 or SC-35), is a prototypical SR protein that plays important roles in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. It is also involved in transcription elongation by directly or indirectly mediating the recruitment of elongation factors to the C-terminal domain of polymerase II. SRSF2 is exclusively localized in the nucleus and is restricted to nuclear processes. It contains a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides. The RRM is responsible for the specific recognition of 5'-SSNG-3' (S=C/G) RNA. In the regulation of alternative splicing events, it specifically binds to cis-regulatory elements on the pre-mRNA. The RS domain modulates SRSF2 activity through phosphorylation, directly contacts RNA, and promotes protein-protein interactions with the spliceosome. SRSF8, also termed SRP46 or SFRS2B, is a novel mammalian SR splicing factor encoded by a PR264/SC35 functional retropseudogene. SRSF8 is localized in the nucleus and does not display the same activity as PR264/SC35.

It can form ternary complexes with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2. Additional research indicates that FUS binds preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. In the presence of Mg2+, it can bind both single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) and promote ATP-independent annealing of complementary ssDNA and D-loop formation in superhelical dsDNA. FUS has been shown to be recruited by single stranded noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, where it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation.

It mediates the inhibitory effect of Rac1 on endocytosis and plays an important role in the Rac1-mediated control of cell growth. Both, synaptojanin-1 and synaptojanin-2, have two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, a shorter isoform expressed in brain and a longer isoform in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-1 contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the cytoplasmic portion of the yeast protein Sac1p, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich region mediating the binding of synaptojanin-1 to various SH3 domain-containing proteins including amphiphysin, SH3p4, SH3p8, SH3p13, and Grb2. Synaptojanin-2 shows high sequence homology to the N-terminal Sac1p homology domain, the central inositol 5-phosphatase domain, the putative RNA recognition motif (RRM) of synaptojanin-1, but differs in the proline-rich region.

259758	PF15628	RRM_DME	RRM in Demeter. This is a predicted RRM-fold domain present at the C-terminus of Demeter-like glycoslyases. These proteins are involved in DNA demethylation in plants where they catalyze removal of the 5mC base and subsequently cleave the backbone through lyase activity. Orthologs of Demeter are present in plants and stramenopiles. The RRM fold domain is predicted to facilitate interaction of the catalytic domain with ssDNA or regulatory RNA.	NA	104	RRM
