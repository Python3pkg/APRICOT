239087	cd02394	vigilin_like_KH	K homology RNA-binding domain_vigilin_like. The vigilin family is a large and extended family of multiple KH-domain proteins, including vigilin, also called high density lipoprotein binding protien (HBP), fungal Scp160 and bicaudal-C. Yeast Scp160p has been shown to bind RNA and to associate with both soluble and membrane-bound polyribosomes as a mRNP component. Bicaudal-C is a RNA-binding molecule believed to function in embryonic development at the post-transcriptional level. In general, KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA. It is found in a wide variety of proteins including ribosomal proteins, transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers of mRNA.	NA	62	KH
241074	cd12630	RRM2_IGF2BP3	RNA recognition motif 2 in vertebrate insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of IGF2BP3 (IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 3 or IMP-3), also termed KH domain-containing protein overexpressed in cancer (KOC), or VICKZ family member 3, an RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in the differentiation process during early embryogenesis. It is known to bind to and repress the translation of IGF2 leader 3 mRNA. IGF2BP3 also acts as a Glioblastoma-specific proproliferative and proinvasive marker acting through IGF2 resulting in the activation of oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (PI3K/MAPK) pathways. IGF2BP3 contains four hnRNP K-homology (KH) domains, two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and a RGG RNA-binding domain.

241132	cd12688	RRM1_PTBP1_like	RNA recognition motif 1 in polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and functions at several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein and negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals.

It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells.
