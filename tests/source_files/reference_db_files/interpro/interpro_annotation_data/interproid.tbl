IPR000467	PF01585	G-patch domain	 The G-patch domain is an approximately 48 amino acid domain, which is found ina single copy in several RNA-associated proteins and in type D retroviralpolyproteins. It is widespread among eukaryotes but is absent in archaea andbacteria. The G-patch domain has been called after its most notable feature,the presence of six highly conserved glycine residues. The position followingthe first conserved glycine is occupied almost invariably by an aromaticresidue, and several other positions are occupied predominantly by eitherhydrophobic or small residues. Several groups of G-patch containing proteinsare conserved in animals, plants and fungi. In some of these proteins the G-patch is the only recognisable domain but in most of them it is combined withother domains, which include well-defined RNA-binding domains, such as theRRM, dsRBD, SURP and R3H. It has been suggested that the G-patch domain has a specific function in RNA processing and, in particular, that it might be a previously undetected RNA-binding domain mediating a distinct type of RNA-protein interaction.Secondary structure prediction indicates that the G-patch domain probablycontains two alpha-helices, with four out of the six glycines located withinan intervening loop.Proteins known to contain a G-patch domain include:Eukaryotic 45 kDa splicing factor (SPF-45).Mammmalian SON protein, a DNA-binding protein.Human LUCA15, a multidomain RNA-binding protein that is the product of a gene deleted in certain lung tumors.Human DAN26/EPROT, a multidomain protein, which, in addition to the G-patch domain, contains an RNA polymerase II C-terminal repeat-binding domain seen in many proteins of the polyA-addition machinery.Arabidopsis thaliana DRT111, a protein which has been shown to partially restore recombination proficiency and DNA-damage resistance to E. coli mutants.Type D retroviral polyprotein, where the G-patch domain is found directly downstream of the protease domain.

The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases. Specificity of RNA binding is determined by multiple contacts with surrounding amino acids. A third helix is present during RNA binding in some cases.

It can be found alone, inassociation with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA bindingdomains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEADbox, or RRM. The functions of thesedomains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA.The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The foldpresents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, against which two alpha-helices pack from one side. This fold isrelated to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of thetranslational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster onthe same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acidrecognition. An extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecularsurface could act as a protein-binding site.	G3DSA:3.30.1370.50|IPB001374|PDOC51061|PF01424|PS51061|SM00393|SSF82708

IPR003954	SM00361	RNA recognition motif domain, eukaryote	 Many eukaryotic proteins that are known or supposed to bind single-stranded RNA contain one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids. This is known as the eukaryotic putative RNA-binding region RNP-1 signature or RNA recognition motif (RRM). RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases. Two individual SMART models were built which identify subtypes of this domain, and are found exclusively in eukaryotes. 	SM00361

IPR009022	PF14492	Elongation factor G, III-V domain	 EF2 (or EFG) participates in the elongation phase of protein synthesis by promoting the GTP-dependent translocation of the peptidyl tRNA of the nascent protein chain from the A-site (acceptor site) to the P-site (peptidyl tRNA site) of the ribosome. EF2 also has a role after the termination phase of translation, where, together with the ribosomal recycling factor, it facilitates the release of tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome, and the splitting of the ribosome into two subunits. EF2 is folded into five domains, with domains I and II forming the N-terminal block, domains IV and V forming the C-terminal block, and domain III providing the covalently-linked flexible connection between the two. Domains III and V have the same fold (although they are not completely superimposable and domain III lacks some of the superfamily characteristics), consisting of an alpha/beta sandwich with an antiparallel beta-sheet in a (beta/alpha/beta)x2 topology. This double split beta/alpha/beta fold is also seen in a number of ribonucleotide binding proteins. It is the most common motif occurring in the translation system and is referred to as the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or RNA recognition (RRM) motif. This domain is found in EF2 proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as in some tetracycline resistance proteins, peptide chain release factors and in the C-terminal region of the bacterial hypothetical protein, YigZ.

IPR018222	PS50177	Nuclear transport factor 2, eukaryote	 Ran is an evolutionary conserved member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that regulates all receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Import receptors bind their cargos in the cytoplasm where the concentration of RanGTP is low and release their cargos in the nucleus where the concentration of RanGTP is high. Export receptors respond to Ran GTP in the opposite manner. Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a homodimer of approximately 14kDa subunits which stimulates efficient nuclear import of a cargo protein. NTF2 binds to both RanGDP and FxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. NTF2 binds to RanGDP sufficiently strongly for the complex to remain intact during transport through NPCs, but the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins is much more transient, which would enable NTF2 to move through the NPC by hopping from one repeat to another . NTF2 folds into a cone with a deep hydrophobic cavity, the opening of which is surrounded by several negatively charged residues. RanGDP binds to NTF2 by inserting a conserved phenylalanine residue into the hydrophobic pocket of NTF2 and making electrostatic interactions with the conserved negatively charged residues that surround the cavity.This entry contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The following proteins contain a region similar to NTF2: Eukaryotic NXF proteins. These are nuclear mRNA export factors. These proteins contain, in addition to a NTF2 domain, a number of leucine-rich repeats and a UBA domain. Eukaryotic NXT1/NXT2 proteins. These proteins are stimulators of protein export for NES-containing proteins. The also play a role in mRNA nuclear export. They heterodimerize with NFX proteins. In contrast to NTF2, NXT1 and NXT2 preferentially bind RanGTP. Eukaryotic Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-binding proteins (G3BP\s). These proteins contain one NTF2 domain and one RRM (see ).

IPR019582	PF10598	RNA recognition motif, spliceosomal PrP8	 The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is the pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 (PrP8) which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RNA- recognition-motif (RRM) are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences. Recognition of RNA targets can also be modulated by a number of other factors, most notably the two loops beta1-alpha1, beta2-beta3 and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the RNP2 domain. 	PF10598

IPR026516	PTHR23080:SF85	THAP domain-containing protein 1	 The THAP domain is a C2CH module with zinc-dependent sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Several THAP domain-containing proteins have been described. Human THAP1 is a transcription regulator that regulates endothelial cell proliferation and G1/S cell-cycle progression. It specifically binds the 5\-ATNTNNGTGGCAAGT-3\ core DNA sequence and acts by modulating expression of pRB-E2F cell-cycle target genes, including RRM1. It is a component of a THAP1/THAP3-HCFC1-OGT complex that is required for the regulation of the transcriptional activity of RRM1. It may also have pro-apoptopic activity by potentiating both serum-withdrawal and TNF-induced apoptosis . Defects in THAP1 are the cause of dystonia type 6 (DYT6). DYT6 is a primary torsion dystonia. Dystonia is defined by the presence of sustained involuntary muscle contractions, often leading to abnormal postures. Dystonia type 6 is characterised by onset in early adulthood, cranial or cervical involvement in about half of the cases, and frequent progression to involve multiple body regions . 	PTHR23080:SF85

Orthologues of Demeter are present in plants and stramenopiles. The RRM fold domain is predicted to facilitate interaction of the catalytic domain with ssDNA or regulatory RNA.	3.2.2|PF15628

IPR029123	PF15519	Splicing factor RBM39, linker	 This entry represents a conserved linker between the second and the third RRM domain in human RBM39 (also known as CAPER) protein and other RNA splicing proteins. CAPER is a transcriptional coactivator of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and estrogen receptors (ERs). This linker was implicated in interactions with ERalpha and ERbeta. Preliminary results from JCSG suggest that this is a structured domain with a well defined fold.	PF15519
IPR030217	PTHR10662	Nuclear RNA export factor	 Mex67 is involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vertebrate TAP (also called NXF1 for nuclear RNA export factor 1) is the orthologue of Mex67. TAP belongs to a multigene family with conserved modular architecture. Other members of the family in humans are NXF2, NXF3, and NFX5. Both TAP(NXF1) and NXF2 bind mRNA and display RNA nuclear export activity. NXF3 also has the ability to export mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but it uses a different mechanism. NXF1 and NXF2 are predominantly nuclear, whereas the cytoplasmic presence of NXF3 and NXF5 suggests that they have a different cellular function .Three functional domains of TAP have been characterised: the RNA-binding domain, the Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, and the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The RNA-binding domain (RBD) of TAP is located at its amino terminus and is composed of two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and one leucine-rich region . Once bound to mRNA, TAP escorts the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) to the nuclear pore, where TAP interacts with nucleoporins via the NTF2-like (NTF2L) and UBA domains.	PTHR10662
IPR031766	PF16842	Occluded RNA-recognition motif	 This is an unusual, usually C-terminal, RNA-recognition motif found in fungi. In yeast it is the fourth RRM domain on the essential splicing factor Prp24. Structurally, it has a non-canonical RRM fold with the expected beta-aloha-beta-beta-alpha-beta RRM-fold is flanked by N- and C-terminal alpha-helices. These two additional flanking alpha-helices occlude the beta-sheet face. The electropositive surface thereby presented is an alternative RNA-binding surface that allows both binding and unwinding of the U6 small nuclear RNA\s internal stem loop, at least in vitro.	PF16842
IPR032226	PF16608	TNRC6, PABC binding domain	 This entry represents a natively unstructured region found in TNRC6 protein that carries the binding motif for the interaction with PABC (polyadenylate-binding protein 1). TNRC6 are trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6 proteins required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing that are localised to the P bodies (processing bodies). P bodies are cytoplasmic mRNP aggregates that are involved in general mRNA translation repression and decay, including nonsense-mediated decay. The interaction motif that binds to PABC is SINWPPEFHPGVPWKGLQ. This region lies between a Q-rich region and the RRM, or RNA-recognition motif.	PF16608

IPR033328	PTHR22978:SF29	Protein BTG2	 BTG2 is a member of the BTG/Tob family. It plays an important role in cellular differentiation and cancer. It is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and has been shown to be a major effector of suppression of Ras-induced transformation by p53 . BTG2 has been shown to function as a transcription cofactor . BTG2 is also found to interact directly with the first RRM domain of the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 and promoted mRNA poly(A) tail shortening . In mice, its overexpression during neurogenesis led to microcephaly, while its deletion triggered impaired neuronal differentiation .The BTG/Tob family members contain an conserved N-terminal domain, known as APRO domain (AntiPROliferative) or BTG domain. In mammals, six family members have been identified: BTG1, BTG2/PC3/Tis21, BTG3/ANA, BTG4/PC3B, Tob1/Tob and Tob2. They interact with CAF1, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. They display antiproliferative properties as their ectopic expression in a variety of cell lines reduced cell proliferation 	PTHR22978:SF29
IPR000504	PF00076	RNA recognition motif domain	 Many eukaryotic proteins containing one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids are known to bind single-stranded RNAs . The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases.

The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases.

IPR002415	PR00883	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, subunit Nhp2, eukaryote	 H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are a family of RNA pseudouridine synthases that specify modification sites through guide RNAs. More than 100 mammalian H/ACA RNAs form an equal number of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by associating with the same four core proteins: Cbf5, Gar1, Nhp2 and Nop10. The function of these H/ACA RNPs is essential for biogenesis of the ribosome, splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), maintenance of telomeres and probably for additional cellular processes. Recent crystal structures of archaeal H/ACA protein complexes show how the same four proteins accommodate &gt;100 distinct but related H/ACA RNAs. The complex contains a stable core composed of Cbf5 and Nop10, to which Gar1 and Nhp2 subsequently bind, the complex interacts with snoRNAs.Nhp2 is part of a complex which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA and is required for rRNA biogenesis. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine ("psi") residues may serve to stabilise the conformation of rRNAs. Nph2 directly binds H/ACA snoRNAs. Nhp2 belongs to the ribosomal protein L7Ae family. 	IPB002415|PR00883

IPR003545	PTHR12066:SF0	Telomerase reverse transcriptase	 Telomerase is an enzyme that, in certain cells, maintains the physical ends of chromosomes (telomeres) during replication. In somatic cells, replication of the lagging strand requires the continual presence of an RNA primer approximately 200 nucleotides upstream, which is complementary to the template strand. Since there is a region of DNA less than 200 base pairs from the end of the chromosome where this is not possible, the chromosome is continually shortened. However, there is a surplus of repetitive DNA at the ends, the telomeres, that protects against the erosion of gene-encoding DNA. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that synthesises the telomeric DNA repeats. The telomerase RNA subunit provides the template for synthesis of these repeats. There are 2 protein components of the RNP: the catalytic subunit is known as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The reverse transcriptase domain is located in the C-terminal region of the TERT polypeptide and single amino acid substitutions in this region lead to telomere shortening and senescence. Telomerase is not normally expressed in somatic cells and it has been suggested that exogenous TERT may extend the lifespan of, or even immortalise, the cell. However, recent studies have shown that telomerase activity can be induced by a number of oncogenes. Conversely, the oncogene c-myc can be activated in human TERT immortalised cells.	2.7.7.49|IPB003545|PR01365|PTHR12066:SF0

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that synthesises the telomeric DNA repeats. The telomerase RNA subunit provides the template for synthesis of these repeats. There are 2 protein components of the RNP: the catalytic subunit is known as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The reverse transcriptase domain is located in the C-terminal region of the TERT polypeptide and single amino acid substitutions in this region lead to telomere shortening and senescence. Telomerase is not normally expressed in somatic cells and it has been suggested that exogenous TERT may extend the lifespan of, or even immortalise, the cell. However, recent studies have shown that telomerase activity can be induced by a number of oncogenes. Conversely, the oncogene c-myc can be activated in human TERT immortalised cells.	2.7.7.49|IPB003545|PR01365|PTHR12066:SF0

IPR003954	SM00361	RNA recognition motif domain, eukaryote	 Many eukaryotic proteins that are known or supposed to bind single-stranded RNA contain one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids. This is known as the eukaryotic putative RNA-binding region RNP-1 signature or RNA recognition motif (RRM). RRMs are found in a variety of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins. The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases. Two individual SMART models were built which identify subtypes of this domain, and are found exclusively in eukaryotes. 	SM00361
IPR004044	PF07650	K Homology domain, type 2	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analyses the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheets are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2. Proteins known to contain a type-2 KH domain include eukaryotic and prokaryotic S3 family of ribosomal proteins, and the prokaryotic GTP-binding protein era.	PDOC50084|PF07650|PS50823

An evolutionarily conserved sequence of around 70 amino acids, the KH domain is present in a wide variety of nucleic acid-binding proteins.

IPR004802	PTHR23127	tRNA pseudouridine synthase B family	 This family, found in archaea and eukaryotes, includes the only archaeal proteins markedly similar to bacterial TruB, the tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase. However, among two related yeast proteins, the archaeal set matches yeast YLR175w far better than YNL292w. The first, termed centromere/microtubule binding protein 5 (CBF5), is an apparent rRNA pseudouridine synthase, while the second is the exclusive tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase for both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. It is unclear whether archaeal proteins found by this entry modify tRNA, rRNA, or both. Yeast CBF5 plays a central role in ribosomal RNA processing. It is a probable catalytic subunit of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Its pseudouridine (\psi\) residues may serve to stabilise the conformation of rRNAs. It may function as a pseudouridine synthase. It is also a centromeric DNA-CBF3-binding factor which is involved in mitotic chromosome segregation . Human CBF5 homologue, DKC1 (also called Dyskerin), has been involved in a variety of disparate cellular functions. DKC1 isoform 1 is required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme. In Hela cells, overexpression of DKC1 isoform 3 promotes cell to cell and cell to substratum adhesion, increases the cell proliferation rate and leads to cytokeratin hyper-expression. Mutations in the human DKC1 gene cause the X-linked form of DC, a bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucosal leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, premature aging, stem cell dysfunction and increased susceptibility to cancer. DKC1 loss of function also causes the Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, recognised as a severe X-DC allelic variant . 	5.4.99|PTHR23127|TIGR00425

Human CBF5 homologue, DKC1 (also called Dyskerin), has been involved in a variety of disparate cellular functions. DKC1 isoform 1 is required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme. In Hela cells, overexpression of DKC1 isoform 3 promotes cell to cell and cell to substratum adhesion, increases the cell proliferation rate and leads to cytokeratin hyper-expression. Mutations in the human DKC1 gene cause the X-linked form of DC, a bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucosal leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, premature aging, stem cell dysfunction and increased susceptibility to cancer. DKC1 loss of function also causes the Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, recognised as a severe X-DC allelic variant . 	5.4.99|PTHR23127|TIGR00425
IPR004802	5.4.99	tRNA pseudouridine synthase B family	 This family, found in archaea and eukaryotes, includes the only archaeal proteins markedly similar to bacterial TruB, the tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase. However, among two related yeast proteins, the archaeal set matches yeast YLR175w far better than YNL292w. The first, termed centromere/microtubule binding protein 5 (CBF5), is an apparent rRNA pseudouridine synthase, while the second is the exclusive tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase for both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. It is unclear whether archaeal proteins found by this entry modify tRNA, rRNA, or both. Yeast CBF5 plays a central role in ribosomal RNA processing. It is a probable catalytic subunit of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Its pseudouridine (\psi\) residues may serve to stabilise the conformation of rRNAs. It may function as a pseudouridine synthase. It is also a centromeric DNA-CBF3-binding factor which is involved in mitotic chromosome segregation .

IPR005120	PF03467	Regulator of nonsense-mediated decay, UPF3	 Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism by which eukaryotic cells detect and degrade transcripts containing premature termination codons. Three \up-frameshift\ proteins, UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3, are essential for this process in organisms ranging from yeast, human to plants . Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited ~24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions after splicing. Translation causes displacement of the EJCs, however, premature translation termination upstream of one or more EJCs triggers the recruitment of UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 and activates the NMD pathway . This family contains UPF3. The crystal structure of the complex between human UPF2 and UPF3b, which are, respectively, a MIF4G (middle portion of eIF4G) domain and an RNP domain (ribonucleoprotein-type RNA-binding domain) has been determined to 1.95A. The protein-protein interface is mediated by highly conserved charged residues in UPF2 and UPF3b and involves the beta-sheet surface of the UPF3b ribonucleoprotein (RNP) domain, which is generally used by these domains to bind nucleic acids. In UPF3b the RNP domain does not bind RNA, whereas the UPF2 construct and the complex do. It is clear that some RNP domains have evolved for specific protein-protein interactions rather than as nucleic acid binding modules.	PF03467

The function of these H/ACA RNPs is essential for biogenesis of the ribosome, splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), maintenance of telomeres and probably for additional cellular processes. Recent crystal structures of archaeal H/ACA protein complexes show how the same four proteins accommodate &gt;100 distinct but related H/ACA RNAs. The complex contains a stable core composed of Cbf5 and Nop10, to which Gar1 and Nhp2 subsequently bind, the complex interacts with snoRNAs.In eukaryotes Nop10 is a nucleolar protein that is specifically associated with H/ACA snoRNAs. It is essential for normal 18S rRNA production and rRNA pseudouridylation by the ribonucleoprotein particles containing H/ACA snoRNAs (H/ACA snoRNPs).

THO is important for stabilising nascent RNA in the RNA polymerase II elongation complex by preventing formation of DNA:RNA hybrids behind the elongating polymerase. It functions in cotranscriptional formation of an export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) by facilitating the loading of ATP-dependent RNA helicase Sub2 and the mRNA export factor Yra1 along the nascent mRNA.

The TROVE domain is also found in bacterialribonucleoproteins suggesting an ancient origin of these ribonucleoproteins.The TROVE domain can be found associated with other domains, such as the VWFAdomain, the TEP1 N-terminal domain, the NACHT-NTPase domain, and WD-40 repeats. The TROVE domain maybe involved in binding the RNA components of the three RNPs, which aretelomerase RNA, Y RNA and vault RNA.The TROVE domain contains a few absolutely conserved residues. As none ofthese conserved residues are the polar type of amino acids found in activesites, it seems unlikely that this region has an enzymatic function.	IPB008858|PDOC50988|PF05731|PS50988
IPR009022	PF14492	Elongation factor G, III-V domain	 EF2 (or EFG) participates in the elongation phase of protein synthesis by promoting the GTP-dependent translocation of the peptidyl tRNA of the nascent protein chain from the A-site (acceptor site) to the P-site (peptidyl tRNA site) of the ribosome. EF2 also has a role after the termination phase of translation, where, together with the ribosomal recycling factor, it facilitates the release of tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome, and the splitting of the ribosome into two subunits. EF2 is folded into five domains, with domains I and II forming the N-terminal block, domains IV and V forming the C-terminal block, and domain III providing the covalently-linked flexible connection between the two. Domains III and V have the same fold (although they are not completely superimposable and domain III lacks some of the superfamily characteristics), consisting of an alpha/beta sandwich with an antiparallel beta-sheet in a (beta/alpha/beta)x2 topology. This double split beta/alpha/beta fold is also seen in a number of ribonucleotide binding proteins. It is the most common motif occurring in the translation system and is referred to as the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or RNA recognition (RRM) motif. This domain is found in EF2 proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as in some tetracycline resistance proteins, peptide chain release factors and in the C-terminal region of the bacterial hypothetical protein, YigZ.

IPR009027	SSF55658	Ribosomal protein L9/RNase H1, N-terminal	 The N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 is a regulatory RNA-binding module that binds to 23rRNA. L9 is composed of two domains and functions as a structural protein in the large subunit of the ribosome. The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic RNase HI, which is lacking in retroviral and prokaryotic enzymes, shows a striking structural similarity to the L9 N-terminal domain, and may also function as a regulatory RNA-binding module. Eukaryotic RNases HI possess either one or two copies of the small N-terminal domain, in addition to the well-conserved catalytic RNase H domain. RNase HI belongs to the family of ribonuclease H enzymes that recognise RNA:DNA hybrids and degrade the RNA component. The structures of both the L9 and the RNase HI N-terminal domains consist of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet sandwiched between two short alpha-helices. The hydrophobic core of the domain is formed by the conserved residues that are involved in the packing of the alpha-helices onto the beta-sheet. The (beta)2/alpha/beta/alpha topology of the domain differs from the structures of known RNA binding domains such as the double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD), the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain and the RNP motif.

IPR010920	SSF50182	LSM domain	 This domain is found as the core structure in Lsm (like-Sm) proteins and bacterial Lsm-related Hfq proteins, and as the middle domain of the mechanosensitive channel protein MscS. In each case, the domain adopts a core structure consisting of an open beta-barrel with an SH3-like topology.Lsm proteins have diverse functions, and are thought to be important modulators of RNA biogenesis and function . The Sm proteins form part of specific small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that are involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs to mature mRNAs, and are a major component of the eukaryotic spliceosome. These snRNPs consist of seven Sm proteins (B/B\, D1, D2, D3, E, F and G), plus a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (either U1, U2, U5 or U4/6). Other snRNPs, such as U7 snRNP, can contain different Lsm proteins. Lsm proteins are also found in archaebacteria, which do not have any splicing apparatus suggesting a more general role for Lsm proteins.The pleiotropic translational regulator Hfq (host factor Q) is a bacterial Lsm-like protein, which modulates the structure of numerous RNA molecules by binding preferentially to A/U-rich sequences in RNA. Hfq forms an Lsm-like fold, however, unlike the heptameric Sm proteins, Hfq forms a homo-hexameric ring.The middle domain of the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance protein (MscS or YggB) structurally resembles an Lsm protein. MscS is a mechanosensitive channel present in the membrane of bacteria, archaea and eukarya that responds both to stretching of the cell membrane and to membrane depolarisation. MscS folds as a homo-heptamer with a cylindrical shape, and can be divided into transmembrane and extramembrane regions: an N-terminal periplasmic region, a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region. The C-terminal cytoplasmic region can be further divided into middle and C-terminal domains, which together create a framework that connects to the cytoplasm through distinct openings. The middle domain exhibits an Lsm-like structure, consisting of five beta-strands that pack together with those of other subunits to form a barrel-like sheet extending around the entire protein.

Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates . Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure.

Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target. C2H2-type (classical) zinc fingers (Znf) were the first class to be characterised. They contain a short beta hairpin and an alpha helix (beta/beta/alpha structure), where a single zinc atom is held in place by Cys(2)His(2) (C2H2) residues in a tetrahedral array. C2H2 Znf\s can be divided into three groups based on the number and pattern of fingers: triple-C2H2 (binds single ligand), multiple-adjacent-C2H2 (binds multiple ligands), and separated paired-C2H2. C2H2 Znf\s are the most common DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotic transcription factors, and have also been identified in prokaryotes. Transcription factors usually contain several Znf\s (each with a conserved beta/beta/alpha structure) capable of making multiple contacts along the DNA, where the C2H2 Znf motifs recognise DNA sequences by binding to the major groove of DNA via a short alpha-helix in the Znf, the Znf spanning 3-4 bases of the DNA. C2H2 Znf\s can also bind to RNA and protein targets.This entry represents a C2H2-type zinc finger motif found in several U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1-C) proteins. Some proteins contain multiple copies of this motif. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5\ splice site at early stages of spliceosome assembly. Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5\ splice site is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5\ splice site. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5\ splice site helps to stabilise U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator.

Recruitment of U1 to a class of weak 5\ splice site is promoted by binding of the protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream from the 5\ splice site. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5\ splice site helps to stabilise U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator.

IPR013085	IPB013085	Zinc finger, U1-C type	 Zinc finger (Znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs which contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. Some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not; instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. For example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. They were first identified as a DNA-binding motif in transcription factor TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates . Their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and of the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. Znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. There are many superfamilies of Znf motifs, varying in both sequence and structure. They display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g. some bind DNA, others protein), suggesting that Znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. For example, Znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mRNA trafficking, cytoskeleton organisation, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodelling and zinc sensing, to name but a few. Zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target. C2H2-type (classical) zinc fingers (Znf) were the first class to be characterised. They contain a short beta hairpin and an alpha helix (beta/beta/alpha structure), where a single zinc atom is held in place by Cys(2)His(2) (C2H2) residues in a tetrahedral array. C2H2 Znf\s can be divided into three groups based on the number and pattern of fingers: triple-C2H2 (binds single ligand), multiple-adjacent-C2H2 (binds multiple ligands), and separated paired-C2H2. C2H2 Znf\s are the most common DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotic transcription factors, and have also been identified in prokaryotes. Transcription factors usually contain several Znf\s (each with a conserved beta/beta/alpha structure) capable of making multiple contacts along the DNA, where the C2H2 Znf motifs recognise DNA sequences by binding to the major groove of DNA via a short alpha-helix in the Znf, the Znf spanning 3-4 bases of the DNA. C2H2 Znf\s can also bind to RNA and protein targets.This entry represents a C2H2-type zinc finger motif found in several U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1-C) proteins. Some proteins contain multiple copies of this motif. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5\ splice site at early stages of spliceosome assembly.

Proteins usually contain two or more structurally similar MIF4G domains connected by unstructured linkers. MIF4G domains are found in several proteins involved in RNA metabolism, including eIF4G (eukaryotic initiation factor 4-gamma), eIF-2b (translation initiation factor), UPF2 (regulator of nonsense transcripts 2), and nuclear cap-binding proteins (CBP80, CBC1, NCBP1), although the sequence identity between them may be low.

CBP80 contains three MIF4G domains connected with long linkers, while CBP20 has an RNP (ribonucleoprotein)-type domain that associates with domains 2 and 3 of CBP80. The complex binds to 5\-cap of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcripts, such as mRNA and U snRNA. The binding is important for several mRNA nuclear maturation steps and for nonsense-mediated decay.

IPR019580	PF10596	Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8, U6-snRNA-binding	 This entry represents the interacting site for U6-snRNA, which is part of U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs complex of the spliceosome is a prime candidate for the role of cofactor in the spliceosome\s RNA core. The essential spliceosomal protein Prp8 interacts with U5 and U6 snRNAs and with specific pre-mRNA sequences that participate in catalysis. This close association with crucial RNA sequences, together with extensive genetic evidence, suggests that Prp8 could directly affect the function of the catalytic core, perhaps acting as a splicing cofactor.

IPR019582	PF10598	RNA recognition motif, spliceosomal PrP8	 The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses pre-mRNA splicing. One of the most conserved core proteins is the pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 (PrP8) which occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, and has been implicated in several crucial molecular rearrangements that occur there, and has recently come under the spotlight for its role in the inherited human disease, Retinitis Pigmentosa. The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RNA- recognition-motif (RRM) are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences. Recognition of RNA targets can also be modulated by a number of other factors, most notably the two loops beta1-alpha1, beta2-beta3 and the amino acid residues C-terminal to the RNP2 domain. 	PF10598
IPR019844	PS00352	Cold-shock conserved site	 When Escherichia coli is exposed to a temperature drop from 37 to 10 degreescentigrade, a 4-5 hour lag phase occurs, after which growth is resumed ata reduced rate . During the lag phase, the expression of around 13proteins, which contain specific DNA-binding regions , is increased2-10 fold. These so-called \cold shock\ proteins are thought to help thecell to survive in temperatures lower than optimum growth temperature, bycontrast with heat shock proteins, which help the cell to survive intemperatures greater than the optimum, possibly by condensation of thechromosome and organisation of the prokaryotic nucleoid .A conserved domain of about 70 amino acids has been found in prokaryotic andeukaryotic DNA-binding proteins . This domain is known as the\cold-shock domain\ (CSD), part of which is highly similar to the RNP-1 RNA-binding motif.This conserved region is located at the N-terminal. The beginning of this region is highly similar to the RNP-1 RNA-binding motif.	PS00352
IPR020321	PD064583	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, subunit Gar1, archaea	 H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are a family of RNA pseudouridine synthases that specify modification sites through guide RNAs. More than 100 mammalian H/ACA RNAs form an equal number of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by associating with the same four core proteins: Cbf5 (the Psi-synthase), Gar1, Nhp2 (L7Ae in archaea) and Nop10. The function of these H/ACA RNPs is essential for biogenesis of the ribosome, splicing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), maintenance of telomeres and probably for additional cellular processes.Crystal structures of archaeal H/ACA protein complexes show how the same four proteins accommodate more than 100 distinct but related H/ACA RNAs. The complex contains a stable core composed of Cbf5 and Nop10, to which Gar1 and Nhp2 subsequently bind.

They both bind to the 3\ end of histone mRNA in frog oocytes. However, their functions are different. SLBP1 participates in histone pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, while oocyte specific SLBP2 doesn\t support the histone pre-mRNA processing and locates in the cytoplasm. SLBP1 binds the 5\ side of the stem-loop structure of replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs and contributes to efficient 3\-end processing by stabilising the complex between histone pre-mRNA and U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), via the histone downstream element (HDE). It plays an important role in targeting mature histone mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to the translation machinery. It stabilises mature histone mRNA and could be involved in cell-cycle regulation of histone gene expression . SLBP2 binds to translationally inactive histone mRNA stored in immature oocytes. When oocytes mature, SLBP2 is degraded and a larger fraction of the histone mRNA is bound to SLBP1. Instead of having a role in histone pre-mRNA processing, SLBP2 may be a specific translational repressor. 	PTHR17408

IPR028389	PTHR14513	Protection of telomeres protein 1	 In most eukaryotes, their chromosome ends are composed of a single stranded overhang that contains GT-rich repeats and are bound by telomerase ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). This entry represents the telombin family, whose members include the protection of telomeres protein 1 (POT1) from humans/fission yeast/plants and the telomere end binding proteins (TEBP) alpha from the hypotrichous ciliate Oxytricha nova. They are ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that play an important role in telomere maintenance, but the precise roles played in end protection and telomere length regulation seem to vary considerably between organisms . In fission yeast, POT1 prevents access of telomerase to the 3\-end and protects against exonucleolytic degradation. However, in humans, POT1 might function predominantly in telomere length regulation rather than in the protection of telomeres. In Arabidopsis, there are several POT-like proteins, including POT1a, POT1b and POT1c. POT1a and POT1b are components of telomerase rather than telomere capping components. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae an OB-fold containing protein called Cdc13 plays a similar role as POT1, such as single-stranded G-rich telomeric DNA binding and telomere maintenance . 	PTHR14513

IPR029344	PF15247	Histone RNA hairpin-binding protein, RNA-binding domain	 This entry represents the RNA-binding domain of histone RNA hairpin-binding protein, also known as SLBP. Proteins containing this domain include SLBP1 and SLBP2 from Xenopus laevis. SLBP1 binds the 5\ side of the stem-loop structure of replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs and contributes to efficient 3\-end processing by stabilising the complex between histone pre-mRNA and U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), via the histone downstream element (HDE). It plays an important role in targeting mature histone mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to the translation machinery. It stabilises mature histone mRNA and could be involved in cell-cycle regulation of histone gene expression . SLBP2 binds to translationally inactive histone mRNA stored in immature oocytes. When oocytes mature, SLBP2 is degraded and a larger fraction of the histone mRNA is bound to SLBP1. Instead of having a role in histone pre-mRNA processing, SLBP2 may be a specific translational repressor. 	PF15247
IPR030217	PTHR10662	Nuclear RNA export factor	 Mex67 is involved in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vertebrate TAP (also called NXF1 for nuclear RNA export factor 1) is the orthologue of Mex67. TAP belongs to a multigene family with conserved modular architecture. Other members of the family in humans are NXF2, NXF3, and NFX5. Both TAP(NXF1) and NXF2 bind mRNA and display RNA nuclear export activity. NXF3 also has the ability to export mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but it uses a different mechanism. NXF1 and NXF2 are predominantly nuclear, whereas the cytoplasmic presence of NXF3 and NXF5 suggests that they have a different cellular function .Three functional domains of TAP have been characterised: the RNA-binding domain, the Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, and the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The RNA-binding domain (RBD) of TAP is located at its amino terminus and is composed of two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and one leucine-rich region . Once bound to mRNA, TAP escorts the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) to the nuclear pore, where TAP interacts with nucleoporins via the NTF2-like (NTF2L) and UBA domains.	PTHR10662
