CDD	P0A6X3	241036	cd12592	RRM_RBM7	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein 7 (RBM7). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM7, a ubiquitously expressed pre-mRNA splicing factor that enhances messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing in a cell-specific manner or in a certain developmental process, such as spermatogenesis. RBM7 interacts with splicing factors SAP145 (the spliceosomal splicing factor 3b subunit 2) and SRp20. It may play a more specific role in meiosis entry and progression. Together with additional testis-specific RNA-binding proteins, RBM7 may regulate the splicing of specific pre-mRNA species that are important in the meiotic cell cycle. RBM7 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus.

CDD	P0A6X3	241037	cd12593	RRM_RBM11	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein 11 (RBM11). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM or RBM11, a novel tissue-specific splicing regulator that is selectively expressed in brain, cerebellum and testis, and to a lower extent in kidney. RBM11 is localized in the nucleoplasm and enriched in SRSF2-containing splicing speckles. It may play a role in the modulation of alternative splicing during neuron and germ cell differentiation. RBM11 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus. The RRM of RBM11 is responsible for RNA binding, whereas the C-terminal region permits nuclear localization and homodimerization.
