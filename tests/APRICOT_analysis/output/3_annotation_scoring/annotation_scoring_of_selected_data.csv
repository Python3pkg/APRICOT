P0A6X3	HFQ_ECOLI	RNA-binding protein Hfq (HF-1) (Host factor-I protein) (HF-I)	Escherichia coli (strain K12)	102	CDD	241036	cd12592	RRM_RBM7	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein 7 (RBM7). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM7, a ubiquitously expressed pre-mRNA splicing factor that enhances messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing in a cell-specific manner or in a certain developmental process, such as spermatogenesis. RBM7 interacts with splicing factors SAP145 (the spliceosomal splicing factor 3b subunit 2) and SRp20. It may play a more specific role in meiosis entry and progression. Together with additional testis-specific RNA-binding proteins, RBM7 may regulate the splicing of specific pre-mRNA species that are important in the meiotic cell cycle. RBM7 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus.	75	4	35	GKPKQFAFVNFKHEVSVPYAMNLLNGIKLYGR	GQSLQDPFLNALRRERVPVSIYLVNGIKLQGQ	CHCHHEHEECEHHHECECEHHCHHCCEHHECH	CHCHHCCEHCHHHHHHECECEEHECCEHHHCH	31.0	13/32 (40%)	19/32 (59%)	0	0.3039	0.4194	0.6129	1.0000	1 (3592.2360, 3649.3590)	0 (325.4210, 500.0280)	1 (552.8323, 628.2586)	1 (2775.0000, 3068.0000)	0 (208.3100, 352.4300)	0.5120	0.6490	0.6010	0.6825	0.6364	0.5840	0.6000	0.5805	0.6400	0.6011258132743056
