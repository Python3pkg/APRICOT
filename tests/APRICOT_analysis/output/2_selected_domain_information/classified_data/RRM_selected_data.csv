This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM7, a ubiquitously expressed pre-mRNA splicing factor that enhances messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing in a cell-specific manner or in a certain developmental process, such as spermatogenesis. RBM7 interacts with splicing factors SAP145 (the spliceosomal splicing factor 3b subunit 2) and SRp20. It may play a more specific role in meiosis entry and progression. Together with additional testis-specific RNA-binding proteins, RBM7 may regulate the splicing of specific pre-mRNA species that are important in the meiotic cell cycle. RBM7 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus.
