>gnl|CDD|274101 TIGR02383, RNA-binding_protein_Hfq, RNA chaperone Hfq.  This
          model represents the RNA-binding pleiotropic regulator
          Hfq, a small, Sm-like protein of bacteria. It helps
          pair regulatory noncoding RNAs with complementary mRNA
          target regions. It enhances the elongation of poly(A)
          tails on mRNA. It appears also to protect RNase E
          recognition sites (A/U-rich sequences with adjacent
          stem-loop structures) from cleavage. Being pleiotropic,
          it differs in some of its activities in different
          species. Hfq binds the non-coding regulatory RNA DsrA
          (see Rfam RF00014) in the few species known to have it:
          Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp. In
          Azorhizobium caulinodans, an hfq mutant is unable to
          express nifA, and Hfq is called NrfA, for nif
          regulatory factor (see . The name hfq reflects
          phenomenology as a host factor for phage Q-beta RNA
          replication. [Regulatory functions, Other].

          RNA-binding protein, functions as a pleiotropic
          regulator of RNA metabolism in prokaryotes, required
          for transcription of some transcripts and degradation
          of others. Hfq binds small RNA molecules called
          riboregulators that modulate the stability or
          translation efficiency of RNA transcripts. Hfq binds
          preferentially to unstructured A/U-rich RNA sequences
          and is similar to the eukaryotic Sm proteins in both
          sequence and structure. Hfq forms a homo-hexameric ring
          similar to the heptameric ring of the Sm proteins.

          particles (snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing

          in four of the major spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs.
          The U6 snRNP binds to the LSM (Like Sm) proteins. Sm
          proteins are also found in archaebacteria, which do not
          have any splicing apparatus suggesting a more general
          role for Sm proteins. All Sm proteins contain a common
          sequence motif in two segments, Sm1 and Sm2, separated
          by a short variable linker. This family also includes
          the bacterial Hfq (host factor Q) proteins. Hfq are
          also RNA-binding proteins, that form hexameric rings.

          RNA-binding protein 7 (RBM7).  This subfamily
          corresponds to the RRM of RBM7, a ubiquitously
          expressed pre-mRNA splicing factor that enhances
          messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing in a cell-specific manner
          or in a certain developmental process, such as
          spermatogenesis. RBM7 interacts with splicing factors

          entry and progression. Together with additional
          testis-specific RNA-binding proteins, RBM7 may regulate
          the splicing of specific pre-mRNA species that are
          important in the meiotic cell cycle. RBM7 contains an
          N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD
          (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain),
          and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus.

>gnl|CDD|259889 cd04227, CuRO_3_FVIII_like, The third cupredoxin domain of
           coagulation factor VIII and similar proteins.  Factor
           VIII functions in the factor X-activating complex of the
           intrinsic coagulation pathway. It facilitates blood
           clotting by acting as a cofactor for factor IXa. In the
           presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids, Factor VIII and IXa
           form a complex that converts factor X to the activated
           form Xa. A variety of mutations in the Factor VIII gene
           can cause hemophilia A, which typically requires
           replacement therapy with purified protein. Factor VIII
           is synthesized as a single polypeptide with six
           cupredoxin domains and a domain structure of
           1-2-3-4-B-5-6-C1-C2, where 1-6 are cupredoxin domains, B
           is a domain with no known structural homologs and is
           dispensible for coagulant activity, and C are domains
           distantly related to discoidin protein-fold family
           members. Factor VIII is initially processed through
           proteolysis to generate a heterodimer consisting of a
           heavy chain (1-2-3-4) and a light chain (5-6-C1-C2),
           which circulates in a tight complex with von Willebrand
           factor (VWF). Further processing of the heavy chain
           produces activated factor VIIIa, a heterotrimer composed
           of polypeptides (1-2), (3-4), and the light chain. This
           model represents the cupredoxin domain 3 of unprocessed
           Factor VIII or the heavy chain of circulating Factor
           VIII, and similar proteins.

          (vWA) domain was originally found in the blood
          coagulation protein von Willebrand factor (vWF).
          Typically, the vWA domain is made up of approximately
          200 amino acid residues folded into a classic a/b
          para-rossmann type of fold. The vWA domain, since its
          discovery, has drawn great interest because of its
          widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide
          variety of important cellular functions. These include
          basal membrane formation, cell migration, cell
          differentiation, adhesion, haemostasis, signaling,
          chromosomal stability, malignant transformation and in
          immune defenses  In integrins these domains form
          heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. There are
          different interaction surfaces of this domain as seen
          by the various molecules it complexes with. Ligand
          binding in most cases is mediated by the presence of a
          metal ion dependent adhesion site termed as the MIDAS
          motif that is a characteristic feature of most, if not
          all A domains. Not much is known about the function of
          the VWA domain in these proteins. The members do have a
          conserved MIDAS motif. The biochemical function however
          is not known.

          PpCmtC. 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate-3,4-dioxygenase (CmtC of
          Pseudomonas putida F1) is a dioxygenase involved in the
          eight-step catabolism pathway of p-cymene. CmtC acts
          upon the reaction intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate,
          yielding
          2-hydroxy-3-carboxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate.
          The CmtC belongs to the type I family of extradiol
          dioxygenases. Fe2+ was suggested as a cofactor, same as
          for other enzymes in the family. The type I family of
          extradiol dioxygenases contains two structurally
          homologous barrel-shaped domains at the N- and

>gnl|CDD|241037 cd12593, RRM_RBM11, RNA recognition motif in vertebrate
          RNA-binding protein 11 (RBM11).  This subfamily
          corresponds to the RRM or RBM11, a novel
          tissue-specific splicing regulator that is selectively
          expressed in brain, cerebellum and testis, and to a
          lower extent in kidney. RBM11 is localized in the
          nucleoplasm and enriched in SRSF2-containing splicing
          speckles. It may play a role in the modulation of
          alternative splicing during neuron and germ cell
          differentiation. RBM11 contains an N-terminal RNA
          recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding
          domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region
          lacking known homology at the C-terminus. The RRM of
          RBM11 is responsible for RNA binding, whereas the
          C-terminal region permits nuclear localization and
          homodimerization. .
