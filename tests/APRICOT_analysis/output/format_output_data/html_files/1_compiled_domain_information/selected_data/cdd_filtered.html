<td>CDD</td><td>P0A6X3</td><td>241036</td><td>cd12592</td><td>RRM_RBM7</td><td>RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein 7 (RBM7). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RBM7, a ubiquitously expressed pre-mRNA splicing factor that enhances messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing in a cell-specific manner or in a certain developmental process, such as spermatogenesis. RBM7 interacts with splicing factors SAP145 (the spliceosomal splicing factor 3b subunit 2) and SRp20. It may play a more specific role in meiosis entry and progression. Together with additional testis-specific RNA-binding proteins, RBM7 may regulate the splicing of specific pre-mRNA species that are important in the meiotic cell cycle. RBM7 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus.</td><td>RRM</td><td>Not-known</td><td>NA</td><td>75</td><td>4</td><td>35</td><td>0.13</td><td>29.1 bits (65)</td><td>29.1</td><td>31</td><td>41.3333</td><td>13/32 (40%)</td><td>17.3333</td><td>19/32 (59%)</td><td>25.3333</td><td>None</td><td>0</td><td>ParameterSelected

<td>CDD</td><td>P0A6X3</td><td>241037</td><td>cd12593</td><td>RRM_RBM11</td><td>RNA recognition motif in vertebrate RNA-binding protein 11 (RBM11). This subfamily corresponds to the RRM or RBM11, a novel tissue-specific splicing regulator that is selectively expressed in brain, cerebellum and testis, and to a lower extent in kidney. RBM11 is localized in the nucleoplasm and enriched in SRSF2-containing splicing speckles. It may play a role in the modulation of alternative splicing during neuron and germ cell differentiation. RBM11 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a region lacking known homology at the C-terminus. The RRM of RBM11 is responsible for RNA binding, whereas the C-terminal region permits nuclear localization and homodimerization.</td><td>RRM</td><td>Not-known</td><td>NA</td><td>75</td><td>11</td><td>35</td><td>5.7</td><td>24.9 bits (54)</td><td>24.9</td><td>24</td><td>32.0000</td><td>11/25 (44%)</td><td>14.6667</td><td>16/25 (64%)</td><td>21.3333</td><td>None</td><td>0</td><td>ParameterDiscarded
