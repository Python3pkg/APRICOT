####For the developers

We have provided a test folder named [tests](https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT/tree/master/tests), to allow the system testing and demonstration of basic modules without installation. The instructions and commands are provided in the shell scipt [system_test.sh](https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT/blob/master/tests/system_test.sh). 

````
$ cd APRICOT/test
$ sh system_test.sh
````

By default, this script generates a main analysis folder `APRICOT_analysis` and several sub-directories. To understand each components of the software and generated results, We recomend you to check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/malvikasharan/APRICOT/blob/master/APRICOT_tutorial.md).
