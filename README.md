##APRICOT
A tool to explore functional classes of proteins.

APRICOT is a computational pipeline for the identification of specific functional classes of interest in large protein sets. APRICOT uses efficient sequence-based algorithms and predictive models like signature motifs of protein families for the characterization of user-provided query proteins with specific functional features. Due to the flexible choice of reference predictive models, APRICOT has potential to identify unexplored functional classes of interest in the entire proteome.

###Introduction

The initial focus of this project was to identify functional domains in bacterial proteins that have the potential to interact with RNA and understand their regulatory roles and mechanisms, therefore it was named as **APRICOT** (stands for **A**nalysing **P**rotein **R**NA **I**nteractions by **Co**mputational **T**echniques). Using this pipeline, a proteome-wide screening of RBPs was carried out in Salmonella Typhimurium. Candidate RNA-interacting proteins were selected and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation and high throughput RNA sequencing based assays (RIP-seq) by experimentalists in our lab to validate their RNA-binding potential and identify bound RNAs. The statistical analysis of the sequencing data indicated a significant number of them as putative RBPs and revealed the distinct expression patterns for the proteins that bind to several RNAs compared to the proteins that have fewer RNA partners.

###Authors and Contributors

The tool is designed and developed by Malvika Sharan @malvikasharan in the lab of Prof. Dr. Jörg Vogel in the Institute for Molecular Infection Biology at the University of Würzburg. Dr. Konrad Förstner @konrad contributed to the project by providing important technical supervision and discussions. The author thanks the members of Vogel lab, especially Dr. Charlotte Michaux and Caroline Tawk for their biological point of views and important contributions in the related projects.

###Documentation

The documentation is under preparation.
