###A tool for sequence-based identification and characterization of protein classes

APRICOT is a computational pipeline for the identification of specific functional classes of interest in large protein sets. The pipeline uses efficient sequence-based algorithms and predictive models like signature motifs of protein families for the characterization of user-provided query proteins with specific functional features. The dynamic framework of APRICOT allows the identification of unexplored functional classes of interest in the large protein sets or the entire proteome.

####Authors and Contributors

The tool is designed and developed by Malvika Sharan @malvikasharan in the lab of Prof. Dr. Jörg Vogel and Dr. Ana Eulalio in the Institute for Molecular Infection Biology at the University of Würzburg. Dr. Konrad Förstner @konrad contributed to the project by providing important technical supervision and discussions. The authors are grateful to Prof. Thomas dandekar, Dr. Charlotte Michaux, Caroline Taouk and Dr. Lars Barquist for critical discussions and feedback.
