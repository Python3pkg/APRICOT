# About
A tool to explore RNA binding proteins.

Here, we aim to develop an efficient and cost-effective computational method for a systematic proteome-wide screening of RBPs with our focus in in bacteria. We exploit avalilable information on functional domains in proteins that may interact with RNA and predict their regulatory roles and mechanisms. For this purpose, we assembled sequence-based approaches for the functional characterization of the proteins in an automated pipeline called APRICOT (Analysing Protein RNA Interactions by Computational Techniques). Using this pipeline, a proteome-wide prediction of RBPs was carried out in Salmonella Typhimurium and selected candidates are being tested by sequencing of immunoprecipitated RNA. The experimental results are recursively used to improve the computational RBP identification.
