IPR001606	SM00501	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

IPR002169	PR00931	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates.

IPR014013	PDOC51192	Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain, DinG/Rad3-type	 Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A(phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B(Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonlyreferred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has beenidentified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA andRNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to beactive as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to beenzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in anenergy-dependent manner.The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with twoalpha-beta RecA-like domains . Thestructural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the fivecontiguous parallel beta strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds tothe amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and WalkerB (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.The carboxy-terminal alpha-beta domain is structurally very similar to theproximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting thatit may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below: DEAD-box RNA helicases.

Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

IPR019657	PF10719	Late competence development protein ComFB	 Competence is the ability of a cell to take up exogenous DNA from its environment, resulting in transformation. It is widespread among bacteria and is probably an important mechanism for the horizontal transfer of genes. DNA usually becomes available by the death and lysis of other cells. Competent bacteria use components of extracellular filaments called type 4 pili to create pores in their membranes and pull DNA through the pores into the cytoplasm. This process, including the development of competence and the expression of the uptake machinery, is regulated in response to cell-cell signalling and/or nutritional conditions.The development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis is a highly regulated adaptive response to stationary-phase stress. For competence to develop, the transcriptional regulator, ComK, must be activated. ComK is required for the expression of genes encoding proteins that function in DNA uptake. In log-phase cultures, ComK is inactive in a complex with MecA and ClpC. The comS gene is induced in response to high culture cell density and nutritional stress and its product functions to release active ComK from the complex. ComK then stimulates the transcription initiation of its own gene as well as that of the late competence operons.The comF locus has three open reading frames and is driven by a single sigma A-like promoter in front of comFORF1. It is dependent on early regulatory competence genes and is only expressed in competence medium. ComFORF1 is similar to an extensive family of ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases with closer similarity to the DEAD protein subfamily and to the PriA protein in Escherichia coli. ComFORF1 late gene product plays an essential role during the binding and uptake events involved in B. subtilis transformation. ComFB is the second protein encoded within the late competence locus ComF. The function of ComFB within late competence development is not known.	PF10719	NA	DEAD

IPR002169	3.4.24.3	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates.

For the two largest groups, commonlyreferred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has beenidentified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA andRNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to beactive as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to beenzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in anenergy-dependent manner.The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with twoalpha-beta RecA-like domains . Thestructural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the fivecontiguous parallel beta strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds tothe amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and WalkerB (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.The carboxy-terminal alpha-beta domain is structurally very similar to theproximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting thatit may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below: DEAD-box RNA helicases.

Theconserved glutamine and aromatic residues interact with the ADP molecule.Some proteins known to contain a Q motif: Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). An ATP-dependent RNA helicase which is a subunit of the eIF4F complex involved in cap recognition and required for mRNA binding to ribosome.

IPR014048	SSF46767	Methylated-DNA-[protein]-cysteine S-methyltransferase, DNA binding	 Synonym(s): 6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, O-6-methylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferaseThis entry represents the DNA binding region of 6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferases. The repair of DNA containing O6-alkylated guanine is carried out by DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferase. The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction since the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and the methylated protein accumulates as a dead-end product. Most, but not all of the methyltransferases are also able to repair O-4-methylthymine. DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferases are widely distributed and are found in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.	2.1.1.63|PF01035|SSF46767|TIGR00589	85	DEAD

IPR002521	PF01542	Hepatitis C virus core protein, C-terminal	 The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (50 nm in size), enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus. It is the only known member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. There are six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus, which are identified numerically (e.g., genotype 1, genotype 2, etc.). Although Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus have similar names, because they all cause liver inflammation, these are distinctly different viruses both genetically and clinically.b"HCV has a positive sense RNA genome that consists of a single open reading frame of 9600 nucleotides. At the 5 and 3 ends of the RNA are the UTR regions that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5 UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES - Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a 3000 amino acid containing protein that is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into 10 active structural and non-structural smaller proteins."The HCV core protein is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence located between the core protein and the E1 envelope glycoprotein. This signal sequence targets the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing the translocation of E1 to the ER lumen. Cleavage by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen releases the N-terminal end of E1, leaving the 191-amino acids (aa) core protein anchored by its C-terminal signal peptide . This 191aa polypeptide, also known as p23, is the immature form of the core protein; p23 is further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), that removes the ER anchor releasing p21, the N-terminal 179aa mature form of the core protein . Core protein (p21) is responsible for packaging viral RNA to form a viral nucleocapsid, and it also promotes virion budding. Two domains have been identified in the mature form of the HCV core protein, based on predicted structural and functional characteristics. Domain I, corresponding to the N-terminal region of approximately 120 aa, is a highly basic domain that is probably involved in the recruitment of viral RNA during particle morphogenesis. Domain II, located between aa 120 and aa 175, is a hydrophobic region predicted to form one or two alpha-helices that are probably involved in the association of core with the ER membrane and lipid droplets. This entry represents domain II and domain III (ER anchor sequence) of the core protein p23. 	PF01542	NA	DEAD

IPR001606	PF01388	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family. Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription. Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells. Mammalian RBP1 and RBP2, retinoblastoma binding factors.Mammalian Mrf-1 and Mrf-2, transcriptional modulators of the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter. Drosophila melanogaster Dead ringer protein, a transcriptional regulatory protein required for early embryonic development. Yeast SWI1 protein, from the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling and broad aspects of transcription regulation. Drosophila melanogaster Osa. It is structurally related to SWI1 and associates with the brahma complex, which is the Drosophila equivalent of the SWI/SNF complex.
