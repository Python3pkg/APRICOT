The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases. Specificity of RNA binding is determined by multiple contacts with surrounding amino acids. A third helix is present during RNA binding in some cases.

IPR018222	PS50177	Nuclear transport factor 2, eukaryote	 Ran is an evolutionary conserved member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that regulates all receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Import receptors bind their cargos in the cytoplasm where the concentration of RanGTP is low and release their cargos in the nucleus where the concentration of RanGTP is high. Export receptors respond to Ran GTP in the opposite manner. Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a homodimer of approximately 14kDa subunits which stimulates efficient nuclear import of a cargo protein. NTF2 binds to both RanGDP and FxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. NTF2 binds to RanGDP sufficiently strongly for the complex to remain intact during transport through NPCs, but the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins is much more transient, which would enable NTF2 to move through the NPC by hopping from one repeat to another . NTF2 folds into a cone with a deep hydrophobic cavity, the opening of which is surrounded by several negatively charged residues. RanGDP binds to NTF2 by inserting a conserved phenylalanine residue into the hydrophobic pocket of NTF2 and making electrostatic interactions with the conserved negatively charged residues that surround the cavity.This entry contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The following proteins contain a region similar to NTF2: Eukaryotic NXF proteins. These are nuclear mRNA export factors. These proteins contain, in addition to a NTF2 domain, a number of leucine-rich repeats and a UBA domain. Eukaryotic NXT1/NXT2 proteins. These proteins are stimulators of protein export for NES-containing proteins. The also play a role in mRNA nuclear export. They heterodimerize with NFX proteins. In contrast to NTF2, NXT1 and NXT2 preferentially bind RanGTP. Eukaryotic Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-binding proteins (G3BP\s). These proteins contain one NTF2 domain and one RRM (see ).

IPR007537	PF04446	tRNAHis guanylyltransferase Thg1	 tRNA His molecules are unusual in having an extra 5\ GMP residue (G(-1)) that, in eukaryotes, is added after transcription and RNase P cleavage. Incorporation of this G(-1) residue is a rare example of nucleotide addition occurring at an RNA 5\ end in a normal phosphodiester linkage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YGR024c (Thg1p) protein is responsible for this guanylyltransferase reaction. It catalyses the guanylyltransferase step of G(-1) addition using a ppp-tRNA His substrate, and appears to catalyse the activation step using p-tRNA His and ATP. Thus, it catalyses phosphodiester bond formation at the 5\ end of RNAs, formally in a 3\-5\ direction. Thg1 has also been shown to interact with the origin recognition complex and to be required for the G2/M phase transition and to have polymerase activity.

IPR024956	2.7.7.79	tRNAHis guanylyltransferase catalytic domain	 The Thg1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for adding a GMP residue to the 5\ end of tRNA His. The catalytic domain of Thg1 contains a RRM (ferredoxin) fold palm domain, just like the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, family A and B DNA polymerases, adenylyl cyclases, diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF domain) and the predicted polymerase of the CRISPR system. Thg1 possesses an active site with three acidic residues that chelate Mg++ cations. Thg1 likely catalyses polymerisation using a similar mechanism to the 5\-3\ polymerases .	2.7.7.79|PF04446	120	RRM

IPR002739	MF_01112	Uncharacterised protein family UPF0201	 Proteins in this family include the PH1010 protein which is composed of five alpha-helices (1-5) and eight beta-strands (1-8) with the following topology: beta-1, alpha-1, beta-2, beta-3, alpha-2, alpha-3, beta-4, beta-5, alpha-4, beta-6, alpha-5, beta-7, beta-8. The first six beta-strands (1-6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel beta-sheet and face five alpha-helices on one side. The last two beta-strands form an antiparallel beta-sheet in the C terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal. Dimerisation of the molecule is crucial for function. The structure resembles that of some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L5. Although the structure resembles that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in this family. Despite this, these proteins bind to double-stranded RNA in a non-sequence specific manner.	IPB002739|MF_01112|PF01877	118	RRM

The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases.

It is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and has been shown to be a major effector of suppression of Ras-induced transformation by p53 .

The R3H domaincontains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that areseparated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern ofhydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, inassociation with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA bindingdomains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEADbox, or RRM.

IPR001313	PF00806	Pumilio RNA-binding repeat	 Members of the Pumilio family of proteins (Puf) regulate translation and mRNAstability in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms including mammals, flies,worms, slime mold, and yeast. Pumilio family members are characterised by the presence of eight tandem copies of an imperfectly repeated 36 amino acids sequence motif, the Pumilio repeat, surrounded by a short N- and C-terminal conserved region. The eight repeats and the N- and C-terminal regions form the Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD). The PUM-HD domain is a sequence-specific RNA binding domain. Several Puf members have been shown to bind specific RNA sequences mainly found in the 3\ UTR of mRNA and repress their translation. Frequently, Puf proteins function asymmetrically to create protein gradients, thus causing asymmetric cell division and regulating cell fate specification.Crystal structure of Pumilio repeats has been solved. The PUM repeat with the N- and C-terminal regions pack together to form a right-handed superhelix that approximates a half doughnut structurally similar to the Armadillo (ARM) repeat proteins, beta-catenin andkaryopherin alpha. The RNA binds the concave surface of the molecule, whereeach of the protein\s eight repeats makes contacts with a different RNA basevia three amino acid side chains at conserved positions.
