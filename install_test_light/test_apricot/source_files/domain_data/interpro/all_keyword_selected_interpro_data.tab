IPR002169	PF01752	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD
IPR007846	IPB007846	RNA-recognition motif (RRM) Nup35-type domain	 The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates the transport of macromolecules acrossthe nuclear envelope (NE). The NPC is composed of a relatively small number ofproteins (~30), termed nucleoporins or Nups. The vertebrate nuclear poreprotein Nup35, the ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup53p, is suggestedto interact with the NE membrane and to be required for nuclear morphology.The highly conserved region between vertebrate Nup35 and yeast Nup53p ispredicted to contain an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain.The sequences of the RRM Nup-35-type domain are highly conserved in alleucaryotes. The RRM Nup35-type domain adopts the characteristic BetaAlphaBetaBetaAlphaBeta topology of the secondary structure elements, with a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet packed against two alpha helices. The RRM Nup35-type domain forms a homodimer and contains atypicalrinonucleoprotein (RNP) motifs, which lack the conserved residues thattypically bind RNA in canonical RRM domains. The dimer interface involves thebeta-sheet surface, with its atypical RNP motifs, which is generally used tobind RNA in typical RRM domains.This entry represents the RRM Nup35-type domain.

IPR004087	SM00322	K Homology domain	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. An evolutionarily conserved sequence of around 70 amino acids, the KH domain is present in a wide variety of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The KH domain binds RNA, and can function in RNA recognition. It is found in multiple copies in several proteins, where they can function cooperatively or independently. For example, in the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP, which has 4 KH domains, KH domains 3 and 4 behave as independent binding modules to interact with different regions of the AU-rich RNA targets. The solution structure of the first KH domain of FMR1 and of the C-terminal KH domain of hnRNP K determined by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) revealed a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure. Proteins containing KH domains include:Bacterial and organelle PNPases.Archaeal and eukaryotic exosome subunits.Eukaryotic and prokaryotic RS3 ribosomal proteins.Vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1).Vigilin, which has 14 KH domains.AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP.hnRNP K, which contains 3 KH domains.Human onconeural ventral antigen-1 (NOVA-1).According to structural analyses the KH domain can be separated in two groups - type 1 and type 2.

IPR018222	PS50177	Nuclear transport factor 2, eukaryote	 Ran is an evolutionary conserved member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that regulates all receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Import receptors bind their cargos in the cytoplasm where the concentration of RanGTP is low and release their cargos in the nucleus where the concentration of RanGTP is high. Export receptors respond to Ran GTP in the opposite manner. Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a homodimer of approximately 14kDa subunits which stimulates efficient nuclear import of a cargo protein. NTF2 binds to both RanGDP and FxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. NTF2 binds to RanGDP sufficiently strongly for the complex to remain intact during transport through NPCs, but the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins is much more transient, which would enable NTF2 to move through the NPC by hopping from one repeat to another . NTF2 folds into a cone with a deep hydrophobic cavity, the opening of which is surrounded by several negatively charged residues. RanGDP binds to NTF2 by inserting a conserved phenylalanine residue into the hydrophobic pocket of NTF2 and making electrostatic interactions with the conserved negatively charged residues that surround the cavity.This entry contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The following proteins contain a region similar to NTF2: Eukaryotic NXF proteins. These are nuclear mRNA export factors. These proteins contain, in addition to a NTF2 domain, a number of leucine-rich repeats and a UBA domain. Eukaryotic NXT1/NXT2 proteins. These proteins are stimulators of protein export for NES-containing proteins. The also play a role in mRNA nuclear export. They heterodimerize with NFX proteins. In contrast to NTF2, NXT1 and NXT2 preferentially bind RanGTP. Eukaryotic Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-binding proteins (G3BP\s). These proteins contain one NTF2 domain and one RRM (see ).

The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

The repair of DNA containing O6-alkylated guanine is carried out by DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferase. The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme.

IPR009019	SSF54814	K homology domain, prokaryotic type	 The K homology domain is a common RNA-binding motif present in one or multiple copies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory proteins. The KH motifs may act cooperatively to bind RNA in the case of multiple motifs, or independently in the case of single KH motif proteins. Prokaryotic (pKH) and eukaryotic (eKH) KH domains share a KH-motif, but have different topologies. The pKH domain has been found in a number of proteins, including the N-terminal domain of the S3 ribosomal protein the C-terminal domain of Era GTPase and the two C-terminal domains of the NusA transcription factor. The structure of the pKH domain consists of a two-layer alpha/beta fold in the arrangement alpha/beta(2)/alpha/beta. 	SSF54814	NA	KH

IPR023799	SSF89919	Ribosome-binding factor A domain	 Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites . About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits. Many ribosomal proteins, particularly those of the large subunit, are composed of a globular, surfaced-exposed domain with long finger-like projections that extend into the rRNA core to stabilise its structure. Most of the proteins interact with multiple RNA elements, often from different domains. In the large subunit, about 1/3 of the 23S rRNA nucleotides are at least in van der Waal\s contact with protein, and L22 interacts with all six domains of the 23S rRNA. Proteins S4 and S7, which initiate assembly of the 16S rRNA, are located at junctions of five and four RNA helices, respectively. In this way proteins serve to organise and stabilise the rRNA tertiary structure. While the crucial activities of decoding and peptide transfer are RNA based, proteins play an active role in functions that may have evolved to streamline the process of protein synthesis. In addition to their function in the ribosome, many ribosomal proteins have some function \outside\ the ribosome .Ribosome-binding factor A (gene rbfA) is a bacterial protein thatassociates with free 30S ribosomal subunits. It does not associate with 30Ssubunits that are part of 70S ribosomes or polysomes. It is essential forefficient processing of 16S rRNA.Ribosome-binding factor A is a protein of from 13 to 15 Kd which is found inmost bacteria. A putative chloroplastic form seems to exist inplants.The structural domain of RbfA has an alpha-beta fold containing three helices and three beta-strands: alpha1-beta1-beta2-alpha2-alpha3-beta3. The structure has type-II KH-domain fold topology, related to conserved KH sequence family proteins whose betaalphaalphabeta subunits are characterised by a helix-turn-helix motif with sequence signature GxxG at the turn. In RbfA, this betaalphaalphabeta subunit is characterised by a helix-kink-helix motif in which the GxxG sequence is replaced by a conserved AxG sequence 	SSF89919	NA	KH

The R3H domaincontains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that areseparated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern ofhydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, inassociation with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA bindingdomains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEADbox, or RRM. The functions of thesedomains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA.The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The foldpresents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, against which two alpha-helices pack from one side. This fold isrelated to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of thetranslational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster onthe same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acidrecognition.

IPR001606	SSF46774	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

The RRM motif is found in numerousRNA-binding proteins, including heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins(hnRNPs), and proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing. TheRRM is a 90-residue domain that binds single-stranded RNA; the structureconsists of four beta-stands and two alpha-helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present in some cases during RNA binding.Three-dimensional modelling of the RBM8 RRM domain indicates that thesequences fold into an RNA-binding domain, forming a hydrophobic corebetween a beta-sheet and two helices.The human RBM8A protein is ubiquitously expressed; the protein is localisedpredominantly in the cell nucleus and diffused throughout the cytoplasm. It preferentially associates with mRNAs produced by splicing, includingboth nuclear mRNAs and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. Evidence suggeststhe protein remains associated with spliced mRNAs as a tag to indicate theposition of spliced introns.

IPR002169	PR00931	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD

The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family. Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription. Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells. Mammalian RBP1 and RBP2, retinoblastoma binding factors.Mammalian Mrf-1 and Mrf-2, transcriptional modulators of the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter.

Yeast SWI1 protein, from the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling and broad aspects of transcription regulation. Drosophila melanogaster Osa. It is structurally related to SWI1 and associates with the brahma complex, which is the Drosophila equivalent of the SWI/SNF complex.

The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction since the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and the methylated protein accumulates as a dead-end product. Most, but not all of the methyltransferases are also able to repair O-4-methylthymine. DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferases are widely distributed and are found in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.This group of proteins are characterised by having an N-terminal ribonuclease-like domain associated with 6-O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activity.	2.1.1.63|IPB008332|PF02870|SSF53155	77	DEAD

It interacts with the secY and secE components of the protein translocation system. It has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the transfer of proteins across the membrane.SecA is a superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that adapted to translocate proteins. It contains the characteristic DEAD/DEXH ATPase core structure with the seven SF2 motifs. Several structural analyses on secA have been reported . They show that secA contains two recA-like domains similar to SF1 and SF2 helicases. In helicases, the two recA-like domains move relative to one another during the ATPase cycle, generating domain movements that translocate the helicase along nucleic acids. In secA, it seems that a similar mechanism is used to generate domain movements that are coupled to polypeptide translocation. The N-terminal recA-like domain of secA contains an insert of about 150 residues that forms the preprotein crosslinking domain (PPXD) which has the ability to bind preproteins in solution and which is important for preprotein loading onto SecYEG-containing membranes.Homologs of secA are also encoded in the chloroplast genome of some algae as well as in the nuclear genome of plants.

IPR002169	IPB002169	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD

The first six beta-strands (1-6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel beta-sheet and face five alpha-helices on one side. The last two beta-strands form an antiparallel beta-sheet in the C terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal. Dimerisation of the molecule is crucial for function. The structure resembles that of some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L5. Although the structure resembles that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in this family.

Prokaryotic (pKH) and eukaryotic (eKH) KH domains share a KH-motif, but have different topologies. The pKH domain has been found in a number of proteins, including the N-terminal domain of the S3 ribosomal protein the C-terminal domain of Era GTPase and the two C-terminal domains of the NusA transcription factor. The structure of the pKH domain consists of a two-layer alpha/beta fold in the arrangement alpha/beta(2)/alpha/beta.

IPR019657	PF10719	Late competence development protein ComFB	 Competence is the ability of a cell to take up exogenous DNA from its environment, resulting in transformation. It is widespread among bacteria and is probably an important mechanism for the horizontal transfer of genes. DNA usually becomes available by the death and lysis of other cells. Competent bacteria use components of extracellular filaments called type 4 pili to create pores in their membranes and pull DNA through the pores into the cytoplasm. This process, including the development of competence and the expression of the uptake machinery, is regulated in response to cell-cell signalling and/or nutritional conditions.The development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis is a highly regulated adaptive response to stationary-phase stress. For competence to develop, the transcriptional regulator, ComK, must be activated. ComK is required for the expression of genes encoding proteins that function in DNA uptake. In log-phase cultures, ComK is inactive in a complex with MecA and ClpC. The comS gene is induced in response to high culture cell density and nutritional stress and its product functions to release active ComK from the complex. ComK then stimulates the transcription initiation of its own gene as well as that of the late competence operons.The comF locus has three open reading frames and is driven by a single sigma A-like promoter in front of comFORF1. It is dependent on early regulatory competence genes and is only expressed in competence medium. ComFORF1 is similar to an extensive family of ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases with closer similarity to the DEAD protein subfamily and to the PriA protein in Escherichia coli. ComFORF1 late gene product plays an essential role during the binding and uptake events involved in B. subtilis transformation. ComFB is the second protein encoded within the late competence locus ComF. The function of ComFB within late competence development is not known.	PF10719	NA	DEAD

IPR002169	3.4.24.3	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	192	DEAD

Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif.

Additionally, it is also found in WD repeat containing proteins,yeast DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases, many RING-finger containing proteins, theUPF0029 uncharacterised protein family and a range of hypothetical proteins. The RWD domain has been named after the better characterised RING finger and WD repeat containing proteins and DEAD-like helicases. It has been proposed that the RWD domain might have a function in protein interaction. The RWD domain is predicted to have an alpha/beta secondary structure and isthought to be related to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCc) domain, althoughthe catalytic cysteine critical for ubiquitin-conjugating activity is notconserved in most members of the novel subfamily.

For example, in the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP, which has 4 KH domains, KH domains 3 and 4 behave as independent binding modules to interact with different regions of the AU-rich RNA targets. The solution structure of the first KH domain of FMR1 and of the C-terminal KH domain of hnRNP K determined by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) revealed a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure. Proteins containing KH domains include:Bacterial and organelle PNPases.Archaeal and eukaryotic exosome subunits.Eukaryotic and prokaryotic RS3 ribosomal proteins.Vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1).Vigilin, which has 14 KH domains.AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP.hnRNP K, which contains 3 KH domains.Human onconeural ventral antigen-1 (NOVA-1).According to structural analyses the KH domain can be separated in two groups - type 1 and type 2.

IPR002521	PF01542	Hepatitis C virus core protein, C-terminal	 The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (50 nm in size), enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus. It is the only known member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. There are six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus, which are identified numerically (e.g., genotype 1, genotype 2, etc.). Although Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus have similar names, because they all cause liver inflammation, these are distinctly different viruses both genetically and clinically.b"HCV has a positive sense RNA genome that consists of a single open reading frame of 9600 nucleotides. At the 5 and 3 ends of the RNA are the UTR regions that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5 UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES - Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a 3000 amino acid containing protein that is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into 10 active structural and non-structural smaller proteins."The HCV core protein is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence located between the core protein and the E1 envelope glycoprotein. This signal sequence targets the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing the translocation of E1 to the ER lumen. Cleavage by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen releases the N-terminal end of E1, leaving the 191-amino acids (aa) core protein anchored by its C-terminal signal peptide . This 191aa polypeptide, also known as p23, is the immature form of the core protein; p23 is further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), that removes the ER anchor releasing p21, the N-terminal 179aa mature form of the core protein . Core protein (p21) is responsible for packaging viral RNA to form a viral nucleocapsid, and it also promotes virion budding. Two domains have been identified in the mature form of the HCV core protein, based on predicted structural and functional characteristics. Domain I, corresponding to the N-terminal region of approximately 120 aa, is a highly basic domain that is probably involved in the recruitment of viral RNA during particle morphogenesis.

IPR023546	2.1.1.63	Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase	 The repair of DNA containing O6-alkylated guanine is carried out by DNA-protein]-cysteine S-methyltransferase (, also known as 6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme . This is a suicide reaction since the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and the methylated protein accumulates as a dead-end product 	2.1.1.63|MF_00772	86	DEAD
IPR001606	PS51011	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family. Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription. Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells. Mammalian RBP1 and RBP2, retinoblastoma binding factors.Mammalian Mrf-1 and Mrf-2, transcriptional modulators of the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter. Drosophila melanogaster Dead ringer protein, a transcriptional regulatory protein required for early embryonic development. Yeast SWI1 protein, from the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling and broad aspects of transcription regulation. Drosophila melanogaster Osa. It is structurally related to SWI1 and associates with the brahma complex, which is the Drosophila equivalent of the SWI/SNF complex.

IPR005662	TIGR00436	GTP-binding protein Era	 Era is an essential G-protein in Escherichia coli identified originally as a homologue protein to Ras (E. coli Ras-like protein). It binds to GTP/GDP and contains a low intrinsic GTPase activity. Its function remains elusive, although it may be associated with cell division, energy metabolism, and cell-cycle check point. The protein has recently been shown to specifically bind to 16S rRNA and the 30S ribosomal subunit. Involvement of Era in protein synthesis is suggested by the fact that Era depletionresults in the translation defect both in vitro and in vivo. A Type 2 KH domain is found near the C terminus.

IPR004088	G3DSA:3.30.1370.10	K Homology domain, type 1	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2. Proteins known to contain a type-1 KH domain include bacterial polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferases ; vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1); eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), one of at least 20 major proteins that are part of hnRNP particles in mammalian cells; mammalian poly(rC) binding proteins; Artemia salina glycine-rich protein GRP33; yeast PAB1-binding protein 2 (PBP2); vertebrate vigilin; and human high-density lipoprotein binding protein (HDL-binding protein).

IPR006575	SM00591	RWD domain	 The RWD domain is a conserved region of about 110 amino acid residues, whichhas been identified in the mouse GCN2 eIF2alpha kinase and histidyl-tRNAsynthetase and in presumed orthologues in other eukaryotic species from yeast tovertebrates. Additionally, it is also found in WD repeat containing proteins,yeast DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases, many RING-finger containing proteins, theUPF0029 uncharacterised protein family and a range of hypothetical proteins. The RWD domain has been named after the better characterised RING finger and WD repeat containing proteins and DEAD-like helicases. It has been proposed that the RWD domain might have a function in protein interaction. The RWD domain is predicted to have an alpha/beta secondary structure and isthought to be related to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCc) domain, althoughthe catalytic cysteine critical for ubiquitin-conjugating activity is notconserved in most members of the novel subfamily.

This subunit is required for \A\ splicing complex assembly (formed by the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA) and \E\ splicing complex assembly. 	PF08920	NA	RRM
IPR028619	MF_00965	ATP-dependent RNA helicase DbpA	 RNA helicases from the DEAD-box family are found in almost all organisms andhave important roles in RNA metabolism, such as splicing, RNA transport,ribosome biogenesis, translation and RNA decay. They are enzymes that unwinddouble-stranded RNA molecules in an energy dependent fashion through thehydrolysis of NTP. DEAD-box RNA helicases belong to superfamily 2 (SF2) ofhelicases. As other SF1 and SF2 members they contain seven conserved motifswhich are characteristic of these two superfamilies.DEAD-box is named after the amino acids of motif II or Walker B (Mg2+-bindingaspartic acid).

IPR001374	PS51061	R3H domain	 The R3H domain is a conserved sequence motif found in proteins from a diverserange of organisms including eubacteria, green plants, fungi and variousgroups of metazoans, but not in archaea and Escherichia coli. The R3H domaincontains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that areseparated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern ofhydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, inassociation with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA bindingdomains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEADbox, or RRM. The functions of thesedomains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA.The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The foldpresents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, against which two alpha-helices pack from one side. This fold isrelated to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of thetranslational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster onthe same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acidrecognition. An extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecularsurface could act as a protein-binding site.	G3DSA:3.30.1370.50|IPB001374|PDOC51061|PF01424|PS51061|SM00393|SSF82708	79	RRM

IPR014013	PS51193	Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain, DinG/Rad3-type	 Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A(phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B(Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonlyreferred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has beenidentified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA andRNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to beactive as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to beenzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in anenergy-dependent manner.The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with twoalpha-beta RecA-like domains . Thestructural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the fivecontiguous parallel beta strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds tothe amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and WalkerB (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.The carboxy-terminal alpha-beta domain is structurally very similar to theproximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting thatit may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below: DEAD-box RNA helicases. The prototype of DEAD-box proteins is the translation initiation factor eIF4A. The eIF4A protein is an RNA-dependent ATPase which functions together with eIF4B as an RNA helicase.DEAH-box RNA helicases.
