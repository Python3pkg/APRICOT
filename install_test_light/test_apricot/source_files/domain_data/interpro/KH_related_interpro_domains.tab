IPR004088	PF15985	K Homology domain, type 1	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta).

In this entry, RRP40 and RRP4 are both non-catalytic components of the RNA exosome complex . Exosome complex RNA-binding protein 1 contains a S1 and a KH domain and is the archaeal ortholog of eukaryotic Rrp4. 	PTHR21321	NA	KH
IPR005662	TIGR00436	GTP-binding protein Era	 Era is an essential G-protein in Escherichia coli identified originally as a homologue protein to Ras (E. coli Ras-like protein). It binds to GTP/GDP and contains a low intrinsic GTPase activity. Its function remains elusive, although it may be associated with cell division, energy metabolism, and cell-cycle check point. The protein has recently been shown to specifically bind to 16S rRNA and the 30S ribosomal subunit. Involvement of Era in protein synthesis is suggested by the fact that Era depletionresults in the translation defect both in vitro and in vivo. A Type 2 KH domain is found near the C terminus.

IPR009019	SSF54814	K homology domain, prokaryotic type	 The K homology domain is a common RNA-binding motif present in one or multiple copies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic regulatory proteins. The KH motifs may act cooperatively to bind RNA in the case of multiple motifs, or independently in the case of single KH motif proteins. Prokaryotic (pKH) and eukaryotic (eKH) KH domains share a KH-motif, but have different topologies. The pKH domain has been found in a number of proteins, including the N-terminal domain of the S3 ribosomal protein the C-terminal domain of Era GTPase and the two C-terminal domains of the NusA transcription factor. The structure of the pKH domain consists of a two-layer alpha/beta fold in the arrangement alpha/beta(2)/alpha/beta. 	SSF54814	NA	KH

Prokaryotic (pKH) and eukaryotic (eKH) KH domains share a KH-motif, but have different topologies. The pKH domain has been found in a number of proteins, including the N-terminal domain of the S3 ribosomal protein the C-terminal domain of Era GTPase and the two C-terminal domains of the NusA transcription factor.

IPR013735	G3DSA:3.30.1480.10	Transcription factor NusA, N-terminal	 This entry represents the N-terminal RNA polymerase-binding domain of bacterial transcription factors such as NusA (N-utilising substance A). NusA is involved in transcriptional pausing, termination and anti-termination. NusA from Thermotoga maritima contains an N-terminal domain and three RNA-binding domains (one S1 domain and two KH domains). The N-terminal domain consists of a bifurcated coiled beta-sheet within an alpha/beta(3)/alpha/beta/alpha fold, which can be divided into two subdomains: a globular head and a helical body. The globular head subdomain may interact with RNA polymerase, while the helical body displays a similar structure to that of the helical domain in sigma70.	G3DSA:3.30.1480.10|PF08529|SSF69705	122	KH
IPR023799	SSF89919	Ribosome-binding factor A domain	 Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites . About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits. Many ribosomal proteins, particularly those of the large subunit, are composed of a globular, surfaced-exposed domain with long finger-like projections that extend into the rRNA core to stabilise its structure. Most of the proteins interact with multiple RNA elements, often from different domains. In the large subunit, about 1/3 of the 23S rRNA nucleotides are at least in van der Waal\s contact with protein, and L22 interacts with all six domains of the 23S rRNA. Proteins S4 and S7, which initiate assembly of the 16S rRNA, are located at junctions of five and four RNA helices, respectively. In this way proteins serve to organise and stabilise the rRNA tertiary structure. While the crucial activities of decoding and peptide transfer are RNA based, proteins play an active role in functions that may have evolved to streamline the process of protein synthesis. In addition to their function in the ribosome, many ribosomal proteins have some function \outside\ the ribosome .Ribosome-binding factor A (gene rbfA) is a bacterial protein thatassociates with free 30S ribosomal subunits. It does not associate with 30Ssubunits that are part of 70S ribosomes or polysomes. It is essential forefficient processing of 16S rRNA.Ribosome-binding factor A is a protein of from 13 to 15 Kd which is found inmost bacteria. A putative chloroplastic form seems to exist inplants.The structural domain of RbfA has an alpha-beta fold containing three helices and three beta-strands: alpha1-beta1-beta2-alpha2-alpha3-beta3. The structure has type-II KH-domain fold topology, related to conserved KH sequence family proteins whose betaalphaalphabeta subunits are characterised by a helix-turn-helix motif with sequence signature GxxG at the turn. In RbfA, this betaalphaalphabeta subunit is characterised by a helix-kink-helix motif in which the GxxG sequence is replaced by a conserved AxG sequence 	SSF89919	NA	KH
IPR029109	PF15534	Bacterial toxin 35	 Prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems are implicated in intra-specific conflicts. They are characterised by a remarkable diversity of C-terminal toxin domains generated by recombination with standalone toxin-coding cassettes. This entry represents a predicted RNase toxin found in bacterial polymorphic toxin systems that is proposed to adopt the BECR (Barnase-EndoU-ColicinE5/D-RelE) fold, and contains a conserved histidine residue and a KH motif. In bacterial polymorphic toxin systems, the toxin is usually exported by the type 2 secretion system.	PF15534	NA	KH

IPR019975	TIGR03675	KH-domain/beta-lactamase-domain protein, archaea	 This family of proteins is universal in the archaea and consists of an N-terminal type-1 KH-domain, a central beta-lactamase-domain, and a C-terminal motif associated with RNA metabolism. KH-domains are associated with RNA-binding, so this protein is a likely metal-dependent RNAase. This family was defined in as arCOG01782. 	TIGR03675	NA	KH
IPR004088	SSF54791	K Homology domain, type 1	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2. Proteins known to contain a type-1 KH domain include bacterial polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferases ; vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1); eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), one of at least 20 major proteins that are part of hnRNP particles in mammalian cells; mammalian poly(rC) binding proteins; Artemia salina glycine-rich protein GRP33; yeast PAB1-binding protein 2 (PBP2); vertebrate vigilin; and human high-density lipoprotein binding protein (HDL-binding protein).

IPR010212	MF_00945_A	Probable transcription termination protein NusA, archaeal	 This entry represents a family of archaeal proteins found in a single copy per genome. It contains two KH domains and is most closely related to the central region bacterial NusA, a transcription termination factor named for its interaction with phage lambda protein N in Escherichia coli. The proteins required for antitermination by N include NusA, NusB, NusE (ribosomal protein S10), and NusG. This system, on the whole, appears not to be present in the archaea.
