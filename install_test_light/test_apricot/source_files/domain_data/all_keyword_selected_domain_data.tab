240755	cd12309	RRM2_Spen	RNA recognition motif 2 in the Spen (split end) protein family. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 domain in the Spen (split end) protein family which includes RNA binding motif protein 15 (RBM15), putative RNA binding motif protein 15B (RBM15B), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. RBM15, also termed one-twenty two protein 1 (OTT1), conserved in eukaryotes, is a novel mRNA export factor and component of the NXF1 pathway. It binds to NXF1 and serves as receptor for the RNA export element RTE. It also possess mRNA export activity and can facilitate the access of DEAD-box protein DBP5 to mRNA at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). RNA-binding protein 15B (RBM15B), also termed one twenty-two 3 (OTT3), is a paralog of RBM15 and therefore has post-transcriptional regulatory activity. It is a nuclear protein sharing with RBM15 the association with the splicing factor compartment and the nuclear envelope as well as the binding to mRNA export factors NXF1 and Aly/REF. Members in this family belong to the Spen (split end) protein family, which share a domain architecture comprising of three N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal) domain.

260057	cd08789	CARD_IPS-1_RIG-I	Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) found in IPS-1 and RIG-I-like RNA helicases. Caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) found in IPS-1 (Interferon beta promoter stimulator protein 1) and Retinoic acid Inducible Gene I (RIG-I)-like DEAD box helicases. RIG-I-like helicases and IPS-1 play important roles in the induction of interferons in response to viral infection. They are crucial in triggering innate immunity and in developing adaptive immunity against viral pathogens. RIG-I-like helicases, including MDA5 and RIG-I, contain two N-terminal CARD domains and a C-terminal DEAD box RNA helicase domain. They are cytoplasmic RNA helicases that play an important role in host antiviral response by sensing incoming viral RNA. Upon activation, the signal is transferred to downstream pathways via the adaptor molecule IPS-1 (MAVS, VISA, CARDIF), leading to the induction of type I interferons. MDA5 and RIG-I associate with IPS-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. In general, CARDs are death domains (DDs) found associated with caspases. They are known to be important in the signaling pathways for apoptosis, inflammation, and host-defense mechanisms. DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures. Their common feature is that they form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by associating with other members of the DD superfamily including PYRIN and DED (Death Effector Domain). They serve as adaptors in signaling pathways and can recruit other proteins into signaling complexes.	NA	91	DEAD
241140	cd12696	RRM3_PTBP2	RNA recognition motif 3 in vertebrate polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of PTBP2, also known as neural polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or neurally-enriched homolog of PTB (nPTB), highly homologous to polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	107	KH
240677	cd12231	RRM2_U2AF65	RNA recognition motif 2 found in U2 large nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 of U2AF65 and dU2AF50. U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies. It associates with intronless mRNAs and plays a significant and unexpected role in the nuclear export of a large number of intronless mRNAs.	NA	77	RRM

A bipartite C-terminal region including the middle and C-terminal G/W-rich regions is referred as silencing domain that triggers silencing of bound transcripts by inhibiting protein expression and promoting mRNA decay via deadenylation. The C-terminal half containing the RRM domain functions as a key effector domain mediating protein synthesis repression by TNRC6C.	NA	83	RRM

LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). It intimately associates with all the nuclear 7SK and is required for 7SK stability. LARP7 also acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of cellular and viral polymerase II genes, acting by means of the 7SK snRNP system. It plays an essential role in the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-dependent transcription, which has been linked to the global control of cell growth and tumorigenesis. LARP7 contains a La motif (LAM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), at the N-terminal region, which mediates binding to the U-rich 3' terminus of 7SK RNA.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64.	NA	75	RRM
240867	cd12421	RRM1_PTBP1_hnRNPL_like	RNA recognition motif in polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP-L), and similar proteins.

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. Rod1 is a mammalian polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It might play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. hnRNP-L is a higher eukaryotic specific subunit of human KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) complex required for histone H3 Lys-36 trimethylation activity. It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. The family also includes polypyrimidine tract binding protein homolog 3 (PTBPH3) found in plant. Although its biological roles remain unclear, PTBPH3 shows significant sequence similarity to other family members, all of which contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). Although their biological roles remain unclear, both PTBPH1 and PTBPH2 show significant sequence similarity to PTB. However, in contrast to PTB, they have three RRMs. In addition, this family also includes RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20) that is an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and contains only one RRM.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of Mei2-like proteins that represent an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins family. Their corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The C-terminal RRM (RRM3) is unique to Mei2-like proteins and it is highly conserved between plants and fungi.

240807	cd12361	RRM1_2_CELF1-6_like	RNA recognition motif 1 and 2 in CELF/Bruno-like family of RNA binding proteins and plant flowering time control protein FCA. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 and RRM2 domains of the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) as well as plant flowering time control protein FCA. CELF, also termed BRUNOL (Bruno-like) proteins, is a family of structurally related RNA-binding proteins involved in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus, and control of mRNA translation and deadenylation in the cytoplasm. The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also known as BRUNOL-2, CUG-BP1, NAPOR, EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also known as BRUNOL-3, ETR-3, CUG-BP2, NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also known as BRUNOL-1, TNRC4, ETR-1, CAGH4, ER DA4), CELF-4 (BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (BRUNOL-5) and CELF-6 (BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both, sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts. This subfamily also includes plant flowering time control protein FCA that functions in the posttranscriptional regulation of transcripts involved in the flowering process. FCA contains two RRMs, and a WW protein interaction domain.	NA	77	RRM

U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of PGC-1alpha, also termed PPARGC-1-alpha, or ligand effect modulator 6, a member of a family of transcription coactivators that plays a central role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. As an inducible transcription coactivator, PGC-1alpha can interact with a broad range of transcription factors involved in a wide variety of biological responses, such as adaptive thermogenesis, skeletal muscle fiber type switching, glucose/fatty acid metabolism, and heart development. PGC-1alpha stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and promotes oxidative metabolism.

Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines.

PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins.

It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. All members in this family contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	74	KH
241155	cd12711	RRM_TNRC6A	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate GW182 autoantigen. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of the GW182 autoantigen, also termed trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6A protein (TNRC6A), or CAG repeat protein 26, or EMSY interactor protein, or protein GW1, or glycine-tryptophan protein of 182 kDa, a phosphorylated cytoplasmic autoantigen involved in stabilizing and/or regulating translation and/or storing several different mRNAs. GW182 is characterized by multiple glycine/tryptophan (G/W) repeats and is a critical component of GW bodies (GWBs, also called mammalian processing bodies, or P bodies). The mRNAs associated with GW182 are presumed to reside within GWBs. GW182 has been shown to bind multiple Ago-miRNA complexes, and thus plays a key role in miRNA-mediated translational repression and mRNA degradation. In the absence of Ago2, GW182 may induce translational silencing effect. GW182 is composed of an N-terminal G/W-rich region containing an Ago hook responsible for Ago protein-binding, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a glutamine (Q)-rich region in the middle region, a middle G/W-rich region, a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal G/W-rich region, at the C-terminus. A bipartite C-terminal region including the middle and C-terminal G/W-rich regions is referred to as silencing domain that triggers silencing of bound transcripts by inhibiting protein expression and promoting mRNA decay via deadenylation.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of nucleoporin Nup53, also termed mitotic phosphoprotein 44 (MP-44), or nuclear pore complex protein Nup53, required for normal cell growth and nuclear morphology in vertebrate. It tightly associates with the nuclear envelope membrane and the nuclear lamina where it interacts with lamin B. It may also interact with a group of nucleoporins including Nup93, Nup155, and Nup205 and play a role in the association of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad1 with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Nup35 contains an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix and several FG repeats. This RRM lacks the conserved residues that typically bind RNA in canonical RRM domains.	NA	74	RRM
250146	PF00806	PUF	Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat. Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as translational repressors in early embryonic development by binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point mutation element (PME) in worm fem-3 mRNA). Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. S. cerevisiae JSN1, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences, some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats. Structures of PUF repeat proteins show they consist of a two helix structure.	IPB001313|PDOC50302|PF00806|PS50302|SM00025	35	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of CBP20, also termed nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 2 (NCBP2), or cell proliferation-inducing gene 55 protein, or NCBP-interacting protein 1 (NIP1). CBP20 is the small subunit of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC), which is a conserved eukaryotic heterodimeric protein complex binding to 5'-capped polymerase II transcripts and plays a central role in the maturation of pre-mRNA and uracil-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA). CBP20 is most likely responsible for the binding of capped RNA.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Man1, also termed LEM domain-containing protein 3 (LEMD3), an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane that binds to nuclear lamins and emerin, thus playing a role in nuclear organization. It is part of a protein complex essential for chromatin organization and cell division. It also functions as an important negative regulator for the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta/activin/Nodal signaling pathway by directly interacting with chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional regulators, including the R-Smads, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3. Moreover, Man1 is a unique type of left-right (LR) signaling regulator that acts on the inner nuclear membrane. Man1 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. The vascular remodeling can be regulated at the inner nuclear membrane through the interaction between Man1 and Smads. Man1 contains an N-terminal LEM domain, two putative transmembrane domains, a MAN1-Src1p C-terminal (MSC) domain, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). The LEM domain interacts with the DNA and chromatin-binding protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor, and is also necessary for efficient localization of MAN1 in the inner nuclear membrane. Research has indicated that C-terminal nucleoplasmic region of Man1 exhibits a DNA binding winged helix domain and is responsible for both DNA- and Smad-binding.	NA	92	RRM

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of synaptojanin-2, also termed synaptic inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 2, an ubiquitously expressed central regulatory enzyme in the phosphoinositide-signaling cascade. As a novel Rac1 effector regulating the early step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, synaptojanin-2 acts as a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase directly and specifically interacting with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner. It mediates the inhibitory effect of Rac1 on endocytosis and plays an important role in the Rac1-mediated control of cell growth. Synaptojanin-2 shows high sequence homology to the N-terminal Sac1p homology domain, the central inositol 5-phosphatase domain, the putative RNA recognition motif (RRM) of synaptojanin-1, but differs in the proline-rich region.

It is encoded by Raly, a ubiquitously expressed gene of unknown function. Raly shows a high degree of identity with the 5' sequences of p542 gene encoding autoantigen, which can cross-react with EBNA-1 of the Epstein Barr virus.

260078	cd08819	CARD_MDA5_r2	Caspase activation and recruitment domain found in MDA5, second repeat. Caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) found in MDA5 (melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5), second repeat. MDA5, also known as IFIH1, contains two N-terminal CARD domains and a C-terminal RNA helicase domain. MDA5 is a cytoplasmic DEAD box RNA helicase that plays an important role in host antiviral response by sensing incoming viral RNA. Upon activation, the signal is transferred to downstream pathways via the adaptor molecule IPS-1 (MAVS, VISA, CARDIF), leading to the induction of type I interferons. Although very similar in sequence, MDA5 recognizes different sets of viruses compared to RIG-I, a related RNA helicase. MDA5 associates with IPS-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. In general, CARDs are death domains (DDs) found associated with caspases. They are known to be important in the signaling pathways for apoptosis, inflammation, and host-defense mechanisms. DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures. Their common feature is that they form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by associating with other members of the DD superfamily including PYRIN and DED (Death Effector Domain). They serve as adaptors in signaling pathways and can recruit other proteins into signaling complexes.	NA	92	DEAD
240673	cd12227	RRM_SCAF4_SCAF8	RNA recognition motif in SR-related and CTD-associated factor 4 (SCAF4), SR-related and CTD-associated factor 8 (SCAF8) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM in a new class of SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors), including SCAF4, SCAF8 and similar proteins. The biological role of SCAF4 remains unclear, but it shows high sequence similarity to SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8). SCAF8 is a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. In addition, SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF8 and SCAF4 both contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of hnRNP G, also termed glycoprotein p43 or RBMX, an RNA-binding motif protein located on the X chromosome. It is expressed ubiquitously and has been implicated in the splicing control of several pre-mRNAs. Moreover, hnRNP G may function as a regulator of transcription for SREBP-1c and GnRH1. Research has shown that hnRNP G may also act as a tumor-suppressor since it upregulates the Txnip gene and promotes the fidelity of DNA end-joining activity. In addition, hnRNP G appears to play a critical role in proper neural development of zebrafish and frog embryos. The family also includes several paralogs of hnRNP G, such as hRBMY and hnRNP G-T (also termed RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked-like-2). Both, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T, are exclusively expressed in testis and critical for male fertility. Like hnRNP G, hRBMY and hnRNP G-T interact with factors implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, such as hTra2-beta1 and T-STAR. Although members in this family share a high conserved N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), they appear to recognize different RNA targets. For instance, hRBMY interacts specifically with a stem-loop structure in which the loop is formed by the sequence CA/UCAA. In contrast, hnRNP G associates with single stranded RNA sequences containing a CCA/C motif. In addition to the RRM, hnRNP G contains a nascent transcripts targeting domain (NTD) in the middle region and a novel auxiliary RNA-binding domain (RBD) in its C-terminal region. The C-terminal RBD exhibits distinct RNA binding specificity, and would play a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing by hnRNP G.	NA	80	RRM

It also acts as a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding brain-specific inositol 5-phosphatase with a putative role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Synaptojanin-1 contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the cytoplasmic portion of the yeast protein Sac1p, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich region mediating the binding of synaptojanin-1 to various SH3 domain-containing proteins including amphiphysin, SH3p4, SH3p8, SH3p13, and Grb2. Synaptojanin-1 has two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, synaptojanin-145 expressed in brain and synaptojanin-170 expressed in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-145 is very abundant in nerve terminals and may play an essential role in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. In contrast to synaptojanin-145, synaptojanin-170 contains three unique asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motifs in the C-terminal region and may functions as a potential binding partner for Eps15, a clathrin coat-associated protein acting as a major substrate for the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor.

It binds specifically to the U2 snRNP and is an intrinsic component of prespliceosomes and spliceosomes. Yeast ist3 contains an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). In the yeast pre-mRNA retention and splicing complex, the atypical RRM of ist3 functions as a scaffold that organizes the other two constituents, Bud13p (bud site selection 13) and Pml1p (pre-mRNA leakage 1). Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene cwf29 encoding ist3, also termed cell cycle control protein cwf29, is an RNA-binding protein complexed with cdc5 protein 29. It also contains one RRM.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of FUS and TAF15. FUS (TLS or Pigpen or hnRNP P2), also termed 75 kDa DNA-pairing protein (POMp75), or oncoprotein TLS (Translocated in liposarcoma), is a member of the FET (previously TET) (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) family of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins whose expression is altered in cancer. It is a multi-functional protein and has been implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, chromosome stability, cell spreading, and transcription. FUS was originally identified in human myxoid and round cell liposarcomas as an oncogenic fusion with the stress-induced DNA-binding transcription factor CHOP (CCAAT enhancer-binding homologous protein) and later as hnRNP P2, a component of hnRNP H complex assembled on pre-mRNA. It can form ternary complexes with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2. Additional research indicates that FUS binds preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. In the presence of Mg2+, it can bind both single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) and promote ATP-independent annealing of complementary ssDNA and D-loop formation in superhelical dsDNA. FUS has been shown to be recruited by single stranded noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, where it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation. TAF15 (TAFII68), also termed TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N (TAF2N), or RNA-binding protein 56 (RBP56), originally identified as a TAF in the general transcription initiation TFIID complex, is a novel RNA/ssDNA-binding protein with homology to the proto-oncoproteins FUS and EWS (also termed EWSR1), belonging to the FET family as well.

SREK1 belongs to a family of proteins containing regions rich in serine-arginine dipeptides (SR proteins family), and is involved in bridge-complex formation and splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions across either introns or exons. It is a unique SR family member and may play a crucial role in determining tissue specific patterns of alternative splicing. SREK1 can alter splice site selection by both positively and negatively modulating the activity of other SR proteins. For instance, SREK1 can activate SRp20 and repress SC35 in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, SREK1 generally contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and two serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains) separated by an unusual glutamic acid-lysine (EK) rich region. The RRM and SR domains are highly conserved among other members of the SR superfamily.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Nrd1 and Seb1. Nrd1 is a novel heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-like RNA-binding protein encoded by gene NRD1 (for nuclear pre-mRNA down-regulation) from yeast S. cerevisiae.

Disruption of NRD1 gene is lethal to yeast cells. Its N-terminal domain is sufficient for viability, which may facilitate interactions with RNA polymerase II where Nrd1 may function as an auxiliary factor. By contrast, the RRM, RE/RS domains, and P+Q domain are dispensable. Seb1 is an RNA-binding protein encoded by gene seb1 (for seven binding) from fission yeast S. pombe.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM1 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and functions at several aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein and negatively regulates the onset of differentiation.

It is predominantly a nuclear protein and it also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm independently of interactions with U1 snRNA. U1A may be involved in RNA 3'-end processing, specifically cleavage, splicing and polyadenylation, through interacting with a large number of non-snRNP proteins, including polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), polypyrimidine-tract binding protein-associated factor (PSF), and non-POU-domain-containing, octamer-binding (NONO), DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5 (DDX5). It also binds to a flavivirus NS5 protein and plays an important role in virus replication. U1A contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), the N-terminal RRM (RRM1) binds tightly and specifically to the U1 snRNA SLII and its own 3'-UTR, while in contrast, the C-terminal RRM (RRM2) does not appear to associate with any RNA and may be free to bind other proteins.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of U11/U12-35K, also termed protein HM-1, or U1 snRNP-binding protein homolog, and is one of the components of the U11/U12 snRNP, which is a subunit of the minor (U12-dependent) spliceosome required for splicing U12-type nuclear pre-mRNA introns. U11/U12-35K is highly conserved among bilateria and plants, but lacks in some organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, U11/U12-35K shows significant sequence homology to U1 snRNP-specific 70 kDa protein (U1-70K or snRNP70). It contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by an adjacent glycine-rich region, and Arg-Asp and Arg-Glu dipeptide repeats rich domain, making U11/U12-35K a possible functional analog of U1-70K. It may facilitate 5' splice site recognition in the minor spliceosome and play a role in exon bridging, interacting with components of the major spliceosome bound to the pyrimidine tract of an upstream U2-type intron.

It contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a glycine hinge and a RS domain in the middle, and a C-terminal domain. The family also includes a novel group of arginine/serine (RS) or serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors existing in plants, such as A. thaliana RSp31, RSp35, RSp41 and similar proteins. Like vertebrate RS splicing factors, these proteins function as plant splicing factors and play crucial roles in constitutive and alternative splicing in plants.

240844	cd12398	RRM_CSTF2_RNA15_like	RNA recognition motif in cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2), yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of CSTF2, its tau variant and eukaryotic homologs. CSTF2, also termed cleavage stimulation factor 64 kDa subunit (CstF64), is the vertebrate conterpart of yeast mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15. It is expressed in all somatic tissues and is one of three cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) subunits required for polyadenylation. CstF64 contains an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a CstF77-binding domain, a repeated MEARA helical region and a conserved C-terminal domain reported to bind the transcription factor PC-4. During polyadenylation, CstF interacts with the pre-mRNA through the RRM of CstF64 at U- or GU-rich sequences within 10 to 30 nucleotides downstream of the cleavage site. CSTF2T, also termed tauCstF64, is a paralog of the X-linked cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 protein that supports polyadenylation in most somatic cells. It is expressed during meiosis and subsequent haploid differentiation in a more limited set of tissues and cell types, largely in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, and to a lesser extent in brain. The loss of CSTF2T will cause male infertility, as it is necessary for spermatogenesis and fertilization. Moreover, CSTF2T is required for expression of genes involved in morphological differentiation of spermatids, as well as for genes having products that function during interaction of motile spermatozoa with eggs. It promotes germ cell-specific patterns of polyadenylation by using its RRM to bind to different sequence elements downstream of polyadenylation sites than does CstF64. The family also includes yeast ortholog mRNA 3'-end-processing protein RNA15 and similar proteins. RNA15 is a core subunit of cleavage factor IA (CFIA), an essential transcriptional 3'-end processing factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RNA recognition by CFIA is mediated by an N-terminal RRM, which is contained in the RNA15 subunit of the complex. The RRM of RNA15 has a strong preference for GU-rich RNAs, mediated by a binding pocket that is entirely conserved in both yeast and vertebrate RNA15 orthologs.	NA	75	RRM

It localizes to the nuclear speckles and associates with multiple splicing components, including splicing cofactors SRm160/300, U snRNAs, assembled splicing complexes, and spliced mRNAs. It may play an important role in pre-mRNA processing by coupling splicing with mRNA 3'-end formation. Additional research indicates that RBM25 is one of the RNA-binding regulators that direct the alternative splicing of apoptotic factors. It can activate proapoptotic Bcl-xS 5'ss by binding to the exonic splicing enhancer, CGGGCA, and stabilize the pre-mRNA-U1 snRNP through interaction with hLuc7A, a U1 snRNP-associated factor.

Upon binding of RNA, hnRNP R forms oligomers, most probably dimers. hnRNP R has been implicated in mRNA processing and mRNA transport, and also acts as a regulator to modify binding to ribosomes and RNA translation. hnRNP R is predominantly located in axons of motor neurons and to a much lower degree in sensory axons. In axons of motor neurons, it also functions as a cytosolic protein and interacts with wild type of survival motor neuron (SMN) proteins directly, further providing a molecular link between SMN and the spliceosome.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the family including yeast cell wall integrity protein scw1, yeast Whi3 protein, yeast Whi4 protein and similar proteins. The strong cell wall protein 1, scw1, is a nonessential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates septation and cell-wall structure in fission yeast. It may function as an inhibitor of septum formation, such that its loss of function allows weak SIN signaling to promote septum formation. It's RRM domain shows high homology to two budding yeast proteins, Whi3 and Whi4. Whi3 is a dose-dependent modulator of cell size and has been implicated in cell cycle control in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It functions as a negative regulator of ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal 3 (Cln3), a G1 cyclin that promotes transcription of many genes to trigger the G1/S transition in budding yeast. It specifically binds the CLN3 mRNA and localizes it into discrete cytoplasmic loci that may locally restrict Cln3 synthesis to modulate cell cycle progression. Moreover, Whi3 plays a key role in cell fate determination in budding yeast. The RRM domain is essential for Whi3 function. Whi4 is a partially redundant homolog of Whi3, also containing one RRM.

Other proteins that contain Puf domains are also plausible RNA binding proteins. S. cerevisiae JSN1, for instance, appears to also contain a single RRM domain by HMM analysis. Puf domains usually occur as a tandem repeat of 8 domains. The Pfam model does not necessarily recognize all 8 repeats in all sequences, some sequences appear to have 5 or 6 repeats on initial analysis, but further analysis suggests the presence of additional divergent repeats.

PUF60 is an essential splicing factor that functions as a poly-U RNA-binding protein required to reconstitute splicing in depleted nuclear extracts. Its function is enhanced through interaction with U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65. PUF60 also controls human c-myc gene expression by binding and inhibiting the transcription factor far upstream sequence element (FUSE)-binding-protein (FBP), an activator of c-myc promoters.

RIG-I is activated by blunt-ended double-stranded RNA with or without a 5'-triphosphate (ppp), by single-stranded RNA marked by a 5'-ppp and by polyuridine sequences. It has been found to confer resistance to many negative-sense RNA viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, bunyaviruses, and paramyxoviruses, as well as the positive-strand hepatitis C virus. RLRs are characterized by a central DExD/H-box helicase domain and a C-terminal domain, both of which are responsible for binding viral RNA.

Caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) found in MDA5 (melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5), first repeat. MDA5, also known as IFIH1, contains two N-terminal CARD domains and a C-terminal RNA helicase domain. MDA5 is a cytoplasmic DEAD box RNA helicase that plays an important role in host antiviral response by sensing incoming viral RNA. Upon activation, the signal is transferred to downstream pathways via the adaptor molecule IPS-1 (MAVS, VISA, CARDIF), leading to the induction of type I interferons. Although very similar in sequence, MDA5 recognizes different sets of viruses compared to RIG-I, a related RNA helicase. MDA5 associates with IPS-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. In general, CARDs are death domains (DDs) found associated with caspases. They are known to be important in the signaling pathways for apoptosis, inflammation, and host-defense mechanisms. DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures. Their common feature is that they form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by associating with other members of the DD superfamily including PYRIN and DED (Death Effector Domain). They serve as adaptors in signaling pathways and can recruit other proteins into signaling complexes.	NA	92	DEAD

Based on the numerous functions, SAFB1 has been implicated in many diverse cellular processes including cell growth and transformation, stress response, and apoptosis. SAFB1 specifically binds to AT-rich scaffold or matrix attachment region DNA elements (S/MAR DNA) by using its N-terminal scaffold attachment factor-box (SAF-box, also known as SAP domain), a homeodomain-like DNA binding motif. The central region of SAFB1 is composed of an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The C-terminus of SAFB1 contains Glu/Arg- and Gly-rich regions that might be involved in protein-protein interaction. Additional studies indicate that the C-terminal region contains a potent and transferable transcriptional repression domain. Another family member is SAFB2, a homolog of SAFB1. Both SAFB1 and SAFB2 are ubiquitously coexpressed and share very high sequence similarity, suggesting that they might function in a similar manner. However, unlike SAFB1, exclusively existing in the nucleus, SAFB2 is also present in the cytoplasm.

It binds with high affinity and specificity for RNA substrates containing hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA (HP92) with either 3' or 5' extensions. As a non-processive ATP-dependent helicase, DbpA destabilizes and unwinds short <9bp (base pairs) RNA duplexes as well as long duplex RNA stretches. It disrupts RNA helices exclusively in a 3'- 5' direction and requires a single-stranded loading site 3' of the substrate helix. dbpA contains two N-terminal ATPase catalytic domains and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain).

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM domain of two structurally related heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, CIRBP (also termed CIRP or A18 hnRNP) and RBM3 (also termed RNPL), both of which belong to a highly conserved cold shock proteins family. The cold shock proteins can be induced after exposure to a moderate cold-shock and other cellular stresses such as UV radiation and hypoxia. CIRBP and RBM3 may function in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to different transcripts, thus allowing the cell to response rapidly to environmental signals. However, the kinetics and degree of cold induction are different between CIRBP and RBM3. Tissue distribution of their expression is different. CIRBP and RBM3 may be differentially regulated under physiological and stress conditions and may play distinct roles in cold responses of cells. CIRBP, also termed glycine-rich RNA-binding protein CIRP, is localized in the nucleus and mediates the cold-induced suppression of cell cycle progression. CIRBP also binds DNA and possibly serves as a chaperone that assists in the folding/unfolding, assembly/disassembly and transport of various proteins. RBM3 may enhance global protein synthesis and the formation of active polysomes while reducing the levels of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing microRNAs. RBM3 may also serve to prevent the loss of muscle mass by its ability to decrease cell death. Furthermore, RBM3 may be essential for cell proliferation and mitosis.

SRSF12 is a serine/arginine (SR) protein-like alternative splicing regulator that antagonizes authentic SR proteins in the modulation of alternative 5' splice site choice. For instance, it activates distal alternative 5' splice site of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of cleavage factor Im (CFIm) subunits. Cleavage factor Im (CFIm) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mRNA 3' processing machinery that functions in UGUA-mediated poly(A) site recognition, the regulation of alternative poly(A) site selection, mRNA export, and mRNA splicing. It is a complex composed of a small 25 kDa (CFIm25) subunit and a larger 59/68/72 kDa subunit. Two separate genes, CPSF6 and CPSF7, code for two isoforms of the large subunit, CFIm68 and CFIm59.

It binds with high affinity and specificity to RNA substrates containing hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA (HP92) with either 3' or 5' extensions in an ATP-dependent manner. YxiN contains two N-terminal ATPase catalytic domains and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain). The catalytic domains bind to nearby regions of RNA to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and disrupt RNA structures. The C-terminal domain is responsible for the high-affinity RNA binding.	NA	73	RRM, DEAD

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of eIF-4B, a multi-domain RNA-binding protein that has been primarily implicated in promoting the binding of 40S ribosomal subunits to mRNA during translation initiation. It contains two RNA-binding domains, the N-terminal well-conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), binds the 18S rRNA of the 40S ribosomal subunit and the C-terminal basic domain (BD), including two arginine-rich motifs (ARMs), binds mRNA during initiation, and is primarily responsible for the stimulation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A. eIF-4B also contains a DRYG domain (a region rich in Asp, Arg, Tyr, and Gly amino acids) in the middle, which is responsible for both, self-association of eIF-4B and binding to the p170 subunit of eIF3. Additional research indicates that eIF-4B can interact with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in mammalian cells, which can stimulate both, the eIF-4B-mediated activation of the helicase activity of eIF-4A and binding of poly(A) by PABP. eIF-4B has also been shown to interact specifically with the internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) of several picornaviruses which facilitate cap-independent translation initiation.

241047	cd12603	RRM_hnRNPC	RNA recognition motif in vertebrate heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNP C1/C2). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP) proteins C1 and C2, produced by a single coding sequence. They are the major constituents of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex in vertebrates. They bind hnRNA tightly, suggesting a central role in the formation of the ubiquitous hnRNP complex. They are involved in the packaging of hnRNA in the nucleus and in processing of pre-mRNA such as splicing and 3'-end formation. hnRNP C proteins contain two distinct domains, an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal auxiliary domain that includes the variable region, the basic region and the KSG box rich in repeated Lys-Ser-Gly sequences, the leucine zipper, and the acidic region. The RRM is capable of binding poly(U). The KSG box may bind to RNA. The leucine zipper may be involved in dimer formation.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM-like Smg4_UPF3 domain found in yeast up-frameshift suppressor 3 (Upf3p), Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4, their human orthologs Upf3A and Upf3B, and similar proteins. Upf3p, also termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay protein 3, or Sua6p, a surveillance factor encoded by UPF3 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in yeast. Upf3p is primarily cytoplasmic but accumulates inside the nucleus. Its nuclear import is mediated by the Srp1p (importin-alpha)/beta heterodimer while its nuclear export is mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES-A), but not the Crm1p exportin. C. elegans SMG-4 is a nuclear shuttling protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus through nuclear import and export signals similar to that of the yeast Upf3p. It is regulated by phosphorylation. Human orthologs of yeast Upf3p and C. elegans SMG-4 include Upf3A and Upf3B, which derive from two genes, UPF3A and X-linked UPF3B, respectively. Both, Upf3A (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog A, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3A, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3A) and Upf3B (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog B on chromosome X, also termed regulator of nonsense transcripts 3B, or nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3B), are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. They associate selectively with spliced beta-globin mRNA in vivo, and tethering of any human Upf protein to the 3'UTR of beta-globin mRNA prevents NMD. The function of the Upf proteins in identifying and targeting nonsense mRNAs for rapid decay is conserved among eukaryotes. Besides, all Upf proteins in this family contain a conserved Smg4_UPF3 domain with some similarity to an RNA recognition motif (RRM), indicating that they may be RNA binding proteins.	NA	88	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two mammalian homologs of Drosophila transformer-2 (Tra2), TRA2-alpha, TRA2-beta (also termed SFRS10), and similar proteins found in eukaryotes. TRA2-alpha is a 40-kDa serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein that specifically binds to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) exonic splicing enhancer on exon 4 (ESE4) and is necessary for enhanced GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. It strongly stimulates GnRH intron A excision in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TRA2-alpha can interact with either 9G8 or SRp30c, which may also be crucial for ESE-dependent GnRH pre-mRNA splicing. TRA2-beta is a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein that controls the pre-mRNA alternative splicing of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) protein and the tau protein. Both, TRA2-alpha and TRA2-beta, contains a well conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), flanked by the N- and C-terminal arginine/serine (RS)-rich regions.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) proteins, a family of structurally related RNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and in the control of mRNA translation and deadenylation in the cytoplasm. The family contains six members: CELF-1 (also termed BRUNOL-2, or CUG-BP1, or NAPOR, or EDEN-BP), CELF-2 (also termed BRUNOL-3, or ETR-3, or CUG-BP2, or NAPOR-2), CELF-3 (also termed BRUNOL-1, or TNRC4, or ETR-1, or CAGH4, or ER DA4), CELF-4 (also termed BRUNOL-4), CELF-5 (also termed BRUNOL-5), CELF-6 (also termed BRUNOL-6). They all contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The low sequence conservation of the linker region is highly suggestive of a large variety in the co-factors that associate with the various CELF family members. Based on both sequence similarity and function, the CELF family can be divided into two subfamilies, the first containing CELFs 1 and 2, and the second containing CELFs 3, 4, 5, and 6. The different CELF proteins may act through different sites on at least some substrates. Furthermore, CELF proteins may interact with each other in varying combinations to influence alternative splicing in different contexts.	NA	73	RRM

CELF-3, expressed in brain and testis only, is also known as bruno-like protein 1 (BRUNOL-1), or CAG repeat protein 4, or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 3, or embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-type RNA-binding protein 1 (ETR-1), or expanded repeat domain protein CAG/CTG 4, or trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 4 protein (TNRC4). It plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. CELF-3 contains three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The effect of CELF-3 on tau splicing is mediated mainly by the RNA-binding activity of RRM2. The divergent linker region might mediate the interaction of CELF-3 with other proteins regulating its activity or involved in target recognition. CELF-4, being highly expressed throughout the brain and in glandular tissues, moderately expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, is also known as bruno-like protein 4 (BRUNOL-4), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 4. Like CELF-3, CELF-4 also contain three highly conserved RRMs. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-4 on some specific substrates is mediated by its RRM1/RRM2. On the other hand, both RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-4 can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. CELF-5, expressed in brain, is also known as bruno-like protein 5 (BRUNOL-5), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 5. Although its biological role remains unclear, CELF-5 shares same domain architecture with CELF-3. CELF-6, being strongly expressed in kidney, brain, and testis, is also known as bruno-like protein 6 (BRUNOL-6), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 6. It activates exon inclusion of a cardiac troponin T minigene in transient transfection assays in a muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE)-dependent manner and can activate inclusion via multiple copies of a single element, MSE2. CELF-6 also promotes skipping of exon 11 of insulin receptor, a known target of CELF activity that is expressed in kidney. In addition to three highly conserved RRMs, CELF-6 also possesses numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within the divergent linker region.

It is previously identified as a putative partner of the TATA-element binding protein. However, it is primarily localized to the nucleolus and physically associates with pre-rRNA processing factors. ESF2 may play a role in ribosome biogenesis. It is required for normal pre-rRNA processing, as well as for SSU processome assembly and function.

Moreover, Cyp33 interacts with the third plant homeodomain (PHD3) zinc finger cassette of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proto-oncoprotein and a poly-A RNA sequence through its RRM domain. It further mediates downregulation of the expression of MLL target genes HOXC8, HOXA9, CDKN1B, and C-MYC, in a proline isomerase-dependent manner.

It has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF35 directly binds to the 3' splice site of the conserved AG dinucleotide and performs multiple functions in the splicing process in a substrate-specific manner. It promotes U2 snRNP binding to the branch-point sequences of introns through association with the large subunit of U2AF, U2AF65 (also termed U2AF2). U2AF35 contains two N-terminal zinc fingers, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal arginine/serine (SR)-rich segment interrupted by glycines. U2AF35 binds both U2AF65 and the pre-mRNA through its RRM domain.	NA	104	RRM

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SRSF7, also termed splicing factor 9G8, is a splicing regulatory serine/arginine (SR) protein that plays a crucial role in both constitutive splicing and alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs. Its localization and functions are tightly regulated by phosphorylation. SRSF7 is predominantly present in the nuclear and can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. It cooperates with the export protein, Tap/NXF1, helps mRNA export to the cytoplasm, and enhances the expression of unspliced mRNA. SRSF7 inhibits tau E10 inclusion through directly interacting with the proximal downstream intron of E10, a clustering region for frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism (FTDP) mutations. SRSF7 contains a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a CCHC-type zinc knuckle motif in its median region, and a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Acinus, a caspase-3-activated nuclear factor that induces apoptotic chromatin condensation after cleavage by caspase-3 without inducing DNA fragmentation. It is essential for apoptotic chromatin condensation and may also participate in nuclear structural changes occurring in normal cells. Acinus contains a P-loop motif and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which indicates Acinus might have ATPase and DNA/RNA-binding activity.

258851	PF14714	KH_dom-like	KH-domain-like of EngA bacterial GTPase enzymes, C-terminal. The KH-like domain at the C-terminus of the EngA subfamily of essential bacterial GTPases has a unique domain structure position. The two adjacent GTPase domains (GD1 and GD2), two domains of family MMR_HSR1, pfam01926, pack at either side of the C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain resembles a KH domain but is missing the distinctive RNA recognition elements. Conserved motifs of the nucleotide binding site of GD1 are integral parts of the GD1-KH domain interface, suggesting the interactions between these two domains are directly influenced by the GTP/GDP cycling of the protein. In contrast, the GD2-KH domain interface is distal to the GDP binding site of GD2.	PF14714	81	KH

PH1010 is composed of five alpha-helices (1-5) and eight beta-strands (1-8) with the following topology: beta-1, alpha-1, beta-2, beta-3, alpha-2, alpha-3, beta-4, beta-5, alpha-4, beta-6, alpha-5, beta-7, beta-8. The first six beta-strands (1-6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel beta-sheet and face five alpha-helices on one side. The last two beta-strands form an antiparallel beta-sheet in the C-terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal. Dimerization of the molecule is crucial for function. The structure resembles that of some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L5. Although the structure resembles that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in this family. Despite this, these proteins bind to double-stranded RNA in a non-sequence specific manner.	IPB002739|MF_01112|PF01877	118	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, and PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC), which serve as mediators between environmental or endogenous signals and the transcriptional machinery governing mitochondrial biogenesis. They play an important integrative role in the control of respiratory gene expression through interacting with a number of transcription factors, such as NRF-1, NRF-2, ERR, CREB and YY1. All family members are multi-domain proteins containing the N-terminal activation domain, an LXXLL coactivator signature, a tetrapeptide motif (DHDY) responsible for HCF binding, and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

Yra1p possesses potent RNA annealing activity and interacts with a number of proteins involved in nuclear transport and RNA processing. It binds to the mRNA export factor Mex67p/TAP and couples transcription to export in yeast. Yra1p is associated with Pse1p and Kap123p, two members of the beta-importin family, further mediating transport of Yra1p into the nucleus. In addition, the co-transcriptional loading of Yra1p is required for autoregulation. Yra1p consists of two highly conserved N- and C-terminal boxes and a central RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of FET (previously TET) (FUS/TLS, EWS, TAF15) family of RNA-binding proteins. This ubiquitously expressed family of similarly structured proteins predominantly localizing to the nuclear, includes FUS (also known as TLS or Pigpen or hnRNP P2), EWS (also known as EWSR1), TAF15 (also known as hTAFII68 or TAF2N or RPB56), and Drosophila Cabeza (also known as SARFH). The corresponding coding genes of these proteins are involved in deleterious genomic rearrangements with transcription factor genes in a variety of human sarcomas and acute leukemias. All FET proteins interact with each other and are therefore likely to be part of the very same protein complexes, which suggests a general bridging role for FET proteins coupling RNA transcription, processing, transport, and DNA repair. The FET proteins contain multiple copies of a degenerate hexapeptide repeat motif at the N-terminus. The C-terminal region consists of a conserved nuclear import and retention signal (C-NLS), a putative zinc-finger domain, and a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which is flanked by 3 arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) boxes. FUS and EWS might have similar sequence specificity, both bind preferentially to GGUG-containing RNAs. FUS has also been shown to bind strongly to human telomeric RNA and to small low-copy-number RNAs tethered to the promoter of cyclin D1. To date, nothing is known about the RNA binding specificity of TAF15.	NA	81	RRM

The endoribonuclease Dicer plays a central role in RNA interference by breaking down RNA molecules into fragments of about 22 nucleotides (miRNAs and siRNAs). Loading of RNA onto Dicer and the enzymatic cleavage are supported by dsRNA-binding proteins, including trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP) or protein activator of PKR (PACT). Together with Argonaute, this constitutes the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which functions to load the small RNA fragments onto Argonaute. The Partner-binding domain of Dicer is responsible for interactions with the dsRNA-binding proteins. This helical domain can be found inserted in a subset of SF2-type DEAD-box related helicases.

The RRM structure consists of four strands and two helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present during RNA binding in some cases The C-terminal beta strand (4th strand) and final helix are hard to align and have been omitted in the SEED alignment The LA proteins have an N terminal rrm which is included in the seed. There is a second region towards the C terminus that has some features characteristic of a rrm but does not appear to have the important structural core of a rrm. The LA proteins are one of the main autoantigens in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease.	IPB000504|PDOC00030|PF00076|PF16367|PS50102|SM00360	70	RRM

LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). It intimately associates with all the nuclear 7SK and is required for 7SK stability. LARP7 also acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of cellular and viral polymerase II genes, acting by means of the 7SK snRNP system. LARP7 plays an essential role in the inhibition of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-dependent transcription, which has been linked to the global control of cell growth and tumorigenesis. LARP7 contains a La motif (LAM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), at the N-terminal region, which mediates binding to the U-rich 3' terminus of 7SK RNA.

240908	cd12462	RRM_SCAF8	RNA recognition motif in SR-related and CTD-associated factor 8 (SCAF8) and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of SCAF8 (also termed CDC5L complex-associated protein 7, or RNA-binding motif protein 16, or CTD-binding SR-like protein RA8), a nuclear matrix protein that interacts specifically with a highly serine-phosphorylated form of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). The pol II CTD plays a role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing. SCAF8 co-localizes primarily with transcription sites that are enriched in nuclear matrix fraction, which is known to contain proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, SCAF8 may play a direct role in coupling with both, transcription and pre-mRNA processing, processes. SCAF8, together with SCAF4, represents a new class of SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors). They contain a conserved N-terminal CTD-interacting domain (CID), an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and serine/arginine-rich motifs.

206646	cd00880	Era_like	E. coli Ras-like protein (Era)-like GTPase. The Era (E. coli Ras-like protein)-like family includes several distinct subfamilies (TrmE/ThdF, FeoB, YihA (EngB), Era, and EngA/YfgK) that generally show sequence conservation in the region between the Walker A and B motifs (G1 and G3 box motifs), to the exclusion of other GTPases. TrmE is ubiquitous in bacteria and is a widespread mitochondrial protein in eukaryotes, but is absent from archaea. The yeast member of TrmE family, MSS1, is involved in mitochondrial translation, bacterial members are often present in translation-related operons. FeoB represents an unusual adaptation of GTPases for high-affinity iron (II) transport. YihA (EngB) family of GTPases is typified by the E. coli YihA, which is an essential protein involved in cell division control. Era is characterized by a distinct derivative of the KH domain (the pseudo-KH domain) which is located C-terminal to the GTPase domain. EngA and its orthologs are composed of two GTPase domains and, since the sequences of the two domains are more similar to each other than to other GTPases, it is likely that an ancient gene duplication, rather than a fusion of evolutionarily distinct GTPases, gave rise to this family.

RH-II/Gualpha, also termed nucleolar RNA helicase 2, or DEAD box protein 21, or nucleolar RNA helicase Gu, is a bifunctional enzyme that displays independent RNA-unwinding and RNA-folding activities. It unwinds double-stranded RNA in the 5' to 3' direction in the presence of Mg2+ through the domains in its N-terminal region. In contrast, it folds single-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner and its C-terminal region is responsible for the Mg2+ independent RNA-foldase activity. RH-II/Gualpha consists of a DEAD box helicase domain (DEAD), a helicase conserved C-terminal domain (helicase_C), and a GUCT followed by three FRGQR repeats and one PRGQR sequence. The DEAD and helicase_C domains may play critical roles in the RNA-helicase activity of RH-II/Gualpha. The function of GUCT domain remains unclear. The C-terminal region responsible for the RNA-foldase activity does not overlap with the GUCT domain. RH-II/Gubeta, also termed ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX50, or DEAD box protein 50, or nucleolar protein Gu2, shows significant sequence homology with RH-II/Gualpha. It contains a DEAD domain, a helicase_C domain, and a GUCT domain followed by an arginine-serine-rich sequence but not (F/P)RGQR repeats in RH-II/Gualpha. Both RH-II/Gualpha and RH-II/Gubeta localize to nucleoli, suggesting roles in ribosomal RNA production, but RH-II/Gubeta also localizes to nuclear speckles containing the splicing factor SC35, suggesting its possible involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In contrast to RH-II/Gualpha, RH-II/Gubeta has RNA-unwinding activity, but no RNA-folding activity.	NA	93	DEAD

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of Mei2-like proteins, representing an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins family. Their corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains).

Overexpressed RCAN3 binds and inhibits the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (also termed PP2B or PP3C), and further down-regulates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-dependent cytokine gene expression in activated human Jurkat T cells. Moreover, RCAN3 interacts with cardiac troponin I (TNNI3), a heart-specific inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex, and may play a role in cardiac contraction.

CELF-1 (also termed BRUNOL-2, or CUG-BP1, or EDEN-BP) and CELF-2 (also termed BRUNOL-3, or ETR-3, or CUG-BP2, or NAPOR) belong to the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) family of RNA-binding proteins that have been implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, and control of mRNA translation and deadenylation. CELF-1 is strongly expressed in all adult and fetal tissues tested. The human CELF-1 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA processing, with implications for onset of type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), a neuromuscular disease associated with an unstable CUG triplet expansion in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of the DMPK (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) gene, it preferentially targets UGU-rich mRNA elements. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. The Xenopus homolog embryo deadenylation element-binding protein (EDEN-BP) mediates sequence-specific deadenylation of Eg5 mRNA. It binds specifically to the EDEN motif in the 3'-untranslated regions of maternal mRNAs and targets these mRNAs for deadenylation and translational repression. CELF-1 contain three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein. The two N-terminal RRMs of EDEN-BP are necessary for the interaction with EDEN as well as a part of the linker region (between RRM2 and RRM3). Oligomerization of EDEN-BP is required for specific mRNA deadenylation and binding. CELF-2 is expressed in all tissues at some level, but highest in brain, heart, and thymus. It has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. CELF-2 shares high sequence identity with CELF-1, but shows different binding specificity, it binds preferentially to sequences with UG repeats and UGUU motifs. It has been shown to bind to a Bruno response element, a cis-element involved in translational control of oskar mRNA in Drosophila, and share sequence similarity to Bruno, the Drosophila protein that mediates this process. It also binds to the 3'-UTR of cyclooxygenase-2 messages, affecting both translation and mRNA stability, and binds to apoB mRNA, regulating its C to U editing. CELF-2 also contains three highly conserved RRMs. It binds to RNA via the first two RRMs, which are also important for localization in the cytoplasm. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-2 on some specific substrates is mediated by RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-2, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. In addition, CELF-2 possesses a typical arginine and lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus, within RRM3. This subgroup also includes Drosophila melanogaster Bruno protein, which plays a central role in regulation of Oskar (Osk) expression in flies. It mediates repression by binding to regulatory Bruno response elements (BREs) in the Osk mRNA 3' UTR.

All four SPSB proteins interact with c-Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, but only SPSB1, SPSB2, and SPSB4 interact with prostate apoptosis response protein 4 (Par-4). They are negative regulators that recruit the ECS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to polyubiquitinate inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), resulting in its proteasomal degradation, thus contributing to protection against the cytotoxic effect of iNOS in activated macrophages. It has been shown that SPSB1 and SPSB4 induce the degradation of iNOS more strongly than SPSB2. The Drosophila melanogaster SPSB1 homolog, GUSTAVUS, interacts with the DEAD box RNA helicase Vasa.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of DND1, also termed RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 4, an RNA-binding protein that is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates. It interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevents micro-RNA (miRNA) mediated repression of mRNA. For instance, DND1 binds cell cycle inhibitor, P27 (p27Kip1, CDKN1B), and cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, LATS2 (large tumor suppressor, homolog 2 of Drosophila).

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of the Set1-like family of histone-lysine N-methyltransferases which includes Set1A and Set1B that are ubiquitously expressed vertebrates histone methyltransferases exhibiting high homology to yeast Set1. Set1A and Set1B proteins exhibit a largely non-overlapping subnuclear distribution in euchromatic nuclear speckles, strongly suggesting that they bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. With the exception of the catalytic component, the subunit composition of the Set1A and Set1B histone methyltransferase complexes are identical. Each complex contains six human homologs of the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex, including Set1A or Set1B, Ash2 (homologous to yeast Bre2), CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1, homologous to yeast Spp1), Rbbp5 (homologous to yeast Swd1), Wdr5 (homologous to yeast Swd3), and Wdr82 (homologous to yeast Swd2). The genomic targeting of these complexes is determined by the identity of the catalytic subunit present in each histone methyltransferase complex. Thus, the Set1A and Set1B complexes may exhibit both overlapping and non-redundant properties. Both Set1A and Set1B contain an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), an N- SET domain, and a C-terminal catalytic SET domain followed by a post-SET domain.

The acidic RasGAP binding domain of G3BP1 harbors an arsenite-regulated phosphorylation site and dominantly inhibits stress granule (SG) formation. G3BP1 also contains an N-terminal nuclear transfer factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM domain), and an Arg-Gly-rich region (RGG-rich region, or arginine methylation motif). The RRM domain and RGG-rich region are canonically associated with RNA binding. G3BP1 co-immunoprecipitates with mRNAs. It binds to and cleaves the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the c-myc mRNA in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thus, G3BP1 may play a role in coupling extra-cellular stimuli to mRNA stability. It has been shown that G3BP1 is a novel Dishevelled-associated protein that is methylated upon Wnt3a stimulation and that arginine methylation of G3BP1 regulates both Ctnnb1 mRNA and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Furthermore, G3BP1 can be associated with the 3'-UTR of beta-F1 mRNA in cytoplasmic RNA-granules, demonstrating that G3BP1 may specifically repress the translation of the transcript.	NA	80	RRM

It contains a single N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by a C-terminal RS domain rich in serine-arginine dipeptides. The RRM is responsible for the specific recognition of 5'-SSNG-3' (S=C/G) RNA. In the regulation of alternative splicing events, it specifically binds to cis-regulatory elements on the pre-mRNA. The RS domain modulates SRSF2 activity through phosphorylation, directly contacts RNA, and promotes protein-protein interactions with the spliceosome. SRSF8, also termed SRP46 or SFRS2B, is a novel mammalian SR splicing factor encoded by a PR264/SC35 functional retropseudogene. SRSF8 is localized in the nucleus and does not display the same activity as PR264/SC35.

They have been implicated in theThe CD corresponds to the RRM. regulation of poly(A) tail length during the polyadenylation reaction, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization by influencing the rate of deadenylation and inhibition of mRNA decapping. The family represents type I polyadenylate-binding proteins (PABPs), including polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP-1 or PABPC1), polyadenylate-binding protein 3 (PABP-3 or PABPC3), polyadenylate-binding protein 4 (PABP-4 or APP-1 or iPABP), polyadenylate-binding protein 5 (PABP-5 or PABPC5), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like (PABP-1-like or PABPC1L), polyadenylate-binding protein 1-like 2 (PABPC1L2 or RBM32), polyadenylate-binding protein 4-like (PABP-4-like or PABPC4L), yeast polyadenylate-binding protein, cytoplasmic and nuclear (PABP or ACBP-67), and similar proteins. PABP-1 is an ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that may play a role in 3' end formation of mRNA, translation initiation, mRNA stabilization, protection of poly(A) from nuclease activity, mRNA deadenylation, inhibition of mRNA decapping, and mRNP maturation. Although PABP-1 is thought to be a cytoplasmic protein, it is also found in the nucleus. PABP-1 may be involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and utilization of mRNP particles. PABP-1 contains four copies of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), a less well conserved linker region, and a proline-rich C-terminal conserved domain (CTD). PABP-3 is a testis-specific poly(A)-binding protein specifically expressed in round spermatids. It is mainly found in mammalian and may play an important role in the testis-specific regulation of mRNA homeostasis. PABP-3 shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1. However, it binds to poly(A) with a lower affinity than PABP-1. Moreover, PABP-1 possesses an A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR and allows binding of PABP and blockage of translation of its own mRNA. In contrast, PABP-3 lacks the A-rich sequence in its 5'-UTR. PABP-4 is an inducible poly(A)-binding protein (iPABP) that is primarily localized to the cytoplasm. It shows significant sequence similarity to PABP-1 as well. The RNA binding properties of PABP-1 and PABP-4 appear to be identical. PABP-5 is encoded by PABPC5 gene within the X-specific subinterval, and expressed in fetal brain and in a range of adult tissues in mammalian, such as ovary and testis. It may play an important role in germ cell development. Moreover, unlike other PABPs, PABP-5 contains only four RRMs, but lacks both the linker region and the CTD. PABP-1-like and PABP-1-like 2 are the orthologs of PABP-1. PABP-4-like is the ortholog of PABP-5. Their cellular functions remain unclear. The family also includes the yeast PABP, a conserved poly(A) binding protein containing poly(A) tails that can be attached to the 3'-ends of mRNAs. The yeast PABP and its homologs may play important roles in the initiation of translation and in mRNA decay. Like vertebrate PABP-1, the yeast PABP contains four RRMs, a linker region, and a proline-rich CTD as well. The first two RRMs are mainly responsible for specific binding to poly(A). The proline-rich region may be involved in protein-protein interactions.	NA	79	RRM

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of two active phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatases, synaptojanin-1 and synaptojanin-2. They have different interaction partners and are likely to have different biological functions. Synaptojanin-1 was originally identified as one of the major Grb2-binding proteins that may participate in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. It also acts as a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding brain-specific inositol 5-phosphatase with a putative role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Synaptojanin-2 is a ubiquitously expressed homolog of synaptojanin-1. It is a novel Rac1 effector regulating the early step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Synaptojanin-2 directly and specifically interacts with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner. It mediates the inhibitory effect of Rac1 on endocytosis and plays an important role in the Rac1-mediated control of cell growth. Both, synaptojanin-1 and synaptojanin-2, have two tissue-specific alternative splicing isoforms, a shorter isoform expressed in brain and a longer isoform in peripheral tissues. Synaptojanin-1 contains an N-terminal domain homologous to the cytoplasmic portion of the yeast protein Sac1p, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a putative RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich region mediating the binding of synaptojanin-1 to various SH3 domain-containing proteins including amphiphysin, SH3p4, SH3p8, SH3p13, and Grb2.

SRSF11 is a unique SR family member and may regulate the alternative splicing in a tissue- and substrate-dependent manner. It can directly interact with the U2 auxiliary factor 65-kDa subunit (U2AF65), a protein associated with the 3' splice site. In addition, unlike the typical SR proteins, SRSF11 associates with other SR proteins but not with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1-70K or the U2 auxiliary factor 35-kDa subunit (U2AF35). SREK1 has unique properties in regulating alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs, it promotes the use of the distal 5' splice site in E1A pre-mRNA alternative splicing. It also inhibits cryptic splice site selection on the beta-globin pre-mRNA containing competing 5' splice sites. SREK1 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains), and one serine-arginine (SR)-rich domains (SR domains).	NA	80	RRM

163687	cd08056	MPN_PRP8	Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domains without isopeptidase activity found in splicing factor Prp8. Members of this family are found in pre-mRNA-processing factor 8 (Prp8) which is a critical splicing factor, interacting with several other spliceosomal proteins, snRNAs, and the pre-mRNA, thus organizing and stabilizing the spliceosome catalytic core. Prp8 is one of the largest and most highly conserved of nuclear proteins, occupying a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome. Its C-terminal domain exhibits a JAB1/MPN-like core similar to deubiquitinating enzymes, but does not show catalytic isopeptidase activity, possibly because the putative isopeptidase center is covered by insertions and terminal appendices that are grafted onto this core, thus impairing the metal binding site. It is proposed that this domain is a protein interaction domain instead of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme as proposed for some MPN proteins. The DEAD-box protein Brr2 and the GTPase Snu114 bind to the Prp8 C-terminus, a region where mutations in human Prp8 (hPrp8) cause a severe form of the genetic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, RP13, which leads to progressive photoreceptor degeneration in the retina and eventual blindness. At the N-terminus of Prp8, there are several domains, including a highly variable nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif rich in prolines, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), and U5 and U6 snRNA binding sites.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of RBM22 (also known as RNA-binding motif protein 22, or Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 16), a newly discovered RNA-binding motif protein which belongs to the SLT11 gene family. SLT11 gene encoding protein (Slt11p) is a splicing factor in yeast, which is required for spliceosome assembly. Slt11p has two distinct biochemical properties: RNA-annealing and RNA-binding activities. RBM22 is the homolog of SLT11 in vertebrate. It has been reported to be involved in pre-splicesome assembly and to interact with the Ca2+-signaling protein ALG-2. It also plays an important role in embryogenesis. RBM22 contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a zinc finger of the unusual type C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H, and a C-terminus that is unusually rich in the amino acids Gly and Pro, including sequences of tetraprolines.

240880	cd12434	RRM_RCAN_like	RNA recognition motif in regulators of calcineurin (RCANs) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of RCANs, a novel family of calcineurin regulators that are key factors contributing to Down syndrome in humans. They can stimulate and inhibit the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (also termed PP2B or PP3C) signaling in vivo through direct interactions with its catalytic subunit. Overexpressed RCANs may bind and inhibit calcineurin. In contrast, low levels of phosphorylated RCANs may stimulate the calcineurin signaling. RCANs are characterized by harboring a central short, unique serine-proline motif containing FLIISPPxSPP box, which is strongly conserved from yeast to human but is absent in bacteria. They consist of an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), a highly conserved SP repeat domain containing the phosphorylation site by GSK-3, a well-known PxIxIT motif responsible for docking many substrates to calcineurin, and an unrecognized C-terminal TxxP motif of unknown function.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of PTBP2, also known as neural polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or neurally-enriched homolog of PTB (nPTB), highly homologous to polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	82	KH
240802	cd12356	RRM_PPARGC1B	RNA recognition motif in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC-1-beta) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of PGC-1beta, also termed PPAR-gamma coactivator 1-beta, or PPARGC-1-beta, or PGC-1-related estrogen receptor alpha coactivator, which is one of the members of PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators family, including PGC-1alpha and PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC). PGC-1beta plays a nonredundant role in controlling mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism and affects both, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis, and functions in a number of oxidative tissues. It is involved in maintaining baseline mitochondrial function and cardiac contractile function following pressure overload hypertrophy by preserving glucose metabolism and preventing oxidative stress. PGC-1beta induces hypertriglyceridemia in response to dietary fats through activating hepatic lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion. It can stimulate apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) expression, further mediating hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid. PGC-1beta also drives nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) target gene expression and NRF-1 and estrogen related receptor alpha (ERRalpha)-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis. The modulation of the expression of PGC-1beta can trigger ERRalpha-induced adipogenesis. PGC-1beta is also a potent regulator inducing angiogenesis in skeletal muscle. The transcriptional activity of PGC-1beta can be increased through binding to host cell factor (HCF), a cellular protein involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and cell cycle regulation. PGC-1beta is a multi-domain protein containing an N-terminal activation domain, an LXXLL coactivator signature, a tetrapeptide motif (DHDY) responsible for HCF binding, two glutamic/aspartic acid-rich acidic domains, and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain). In contrast to PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta lacks most of the arginine/serine (SR)-rich domain that is responsible for the regulation of RNA processing.	NA	79	RRM

UHMK1 targets two key regulators of cell proliferation and migration, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 and the microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin. It plays a critical role during vascular wound repair by preventing excessive vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration into the vascular lesion. Moreover, UHMK1 may control cell migration and neurite outgrowth by interacting with and phosphorylating the splicing factor SF1, thereby probably contributing to the control of protein expression. Furthermore, UHMK1 may be functionally related to microtubule dynamics and axon development. It localizes to RNA granules, interacts with three proteins found in RNA granules (KIF3A, NonO, and eEF1A), and further enhances the local translation. UHMK1 is highly expressed in regions of the brain implicated in schizophrenia and may play a role in susceptibility to schizophrenia.	NA	88	RRM

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM1 of U2B" (also termed U2 snRNP B") a unique protein that comprises the U2 snRNP. It was initially identified as binding to stem-loop IV (SLIV) at the 3' end of U2 snRNA. Additional research indicates U2B" binds to U1 snRNA stem-loop II (SLII) as well and shows no preference for SLIV or SLII on the basis of binding affinity. U2B" does not require an auxiliary protein for binding to RNA. In addition, the nuclear transport of U2B" is independent of U2 snRNA binding. U2B" contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). It also contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the central domain. However, nuclear import of U2B'' does not depend on this NLS.

The RBD's include one S1 domain and two KH domains that form an RNA binding surface. DNA transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) includes three phases - initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, sigma factors bind RNAP and target RNAP to specific promoters. During elongation, N-utilization substances (NusA, B, E, and G) replace sigma factors and regulate pausing, termination, and antitermination. NusA is cold-shock-inducible.	NA	67	KH
240973	cd12529	RRM2_MEI2_like	RNA recognition motif 2 in plant Mei2-like proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of Mei2-like proteins that represent an ancient eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins family. Their corresponding Mei2-like genes appear to have arisen early in eukaryote evolution, been lost from some lineages such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, and diversified in the plant lineage. The plant Mei2-like genes may function in cell fate specification during development, rather than as stimulators of meiosis. Members in this family contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The C-terminal RRM (RRM3) is unique to Mei2-like proteins and is highly conserved between plants and fungi.

It is an RNA-binding protein that is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates. It interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevents micro-RNA (miRNA) mediated repression of mRNA. For instance, DND1 binds cell cycle inhibitor, P27 (p27Kip1, CDKN1B), and cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, LATS2 (large tumor suppressor, homolog 2 of Drosophila). It helps maintain their protein expression through blocking the inhibitory function of microRNAs (miRNA) from these transcripts. DND1 may also impose another level of translational regulation to modulate expression of critical factors in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Moreover, DND1 interacts specifically with apolipoprotein B editing complex 3 (APOBEC3), a multi-functional protein inhibiting retroviral replication. The DND1-APOBEC3 interaction may play a role in maintaining viability of germ cells and for preventing germ cell tumor development. DND1 contains two conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains).	NA	83	DEAD

Catalytic domain of type II restriction endonucleases BfiI and NgoFVII, uncharacterized type III restriction endonuclease Res subunit, and uncharacterized DNA/RNA helicase superfamily II members. Proteins in this family are found mainly in prokaryotes. They contain one copy of the conserved HKD motif (H-x-K-x(4)-D, where x represents any amino acid residue) in a single polypeptide chain, and have been classified as members of the phospholipase D (PLD, EC 3.1.4.4) superfamily. BfiI consists of two discrete domains with distinct functions: an N-terminal catalytic domain with non-specific nuclease activity and dimerization function that is more closely related to Nuc, an EDTA-resistant nuclease from the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, and a C-terminal domain that specifically recognizes its target sequences, 5'-ACTGGG-3'. BfiI forms a functionally active homodimer which has two DNA-binding surfaces located at the C-terminal domains but only one active site, located at the dimer interface between the two N-terminal catalytic domains that contain the two HKD motifs from both subunits. BfiI utilizes a single active site to cut both DNA strands, which represents a novel mechanism for the scission of double-stranded DNA. It uses a histidine residue from the HKD motif in one subunit as the nucleophile for the cleavage of the target phosphodiester bond in both of the anti-parallel DNA strands, while the symmetrically-related histidine residue from the HKD motif of the opposite subunit acts as the proton donor/acceptor during both strand-scission events.

U2AF65, also termed U2AF2, is the large subunit of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) auxiliary factor (U2AF), which has been implicated in the recruitment of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNAs and is a highly conserved heterodimer composed of large and small subunits. U2AF65 specifically recognizes the intron polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site and promotes binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branchpoint. U2AF65 also plays an important role in the nuclear export of mRNA. It facilitates the formation of a messenger ribonucleoprotein export complex, containing both the NXF1 receptor and the RNA substrate. Moreover, U2AF65 interacts directly and specifically with expanded CAG RNA, and serves as an adaptor to link expanded CAG RNA to NXF1 for RNA export. U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain rich in arginine and serine, followed by a proline-rich segment and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). The N-terminal RS domain stabilizes the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch point (BP) by contacting the branch region, and further promotes base pair interactions between U2 snRNA and the BP. The proline-rich segment mediates protein-protein interactions with the RRM domain of the small U2AF subunit (U2AF35 or U2AF1). The RRM1 and RRM2 are sufficient for specific RNA binding, while RRM3 is responsible for protein-protein interactions. The family also includes Splicing factor U2AF 50 kDa subunit (dU2AF50), the Drosophila ortholog of U2AF65. dU2AF50 functions as an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor in flies.

PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. Rod1 is a mammalian polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It might play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. hnRNP-L is a higher eukaryotic specific subunit of human KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) complex required for histone H3 Lys-36 trimethylation activity. It plays both, nuclear and cytoplasmic, roles in mRNA export of intronless genes, IRES-mediated translation, mRNA stability, and splicing. hnRNP-LL protein plays a critical and unique role in the signal-induced regulation of CD45 and acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. This family also includes polypyrimidine tract binding protein homolog 3 (PTBPH3) found in plant. Although its biological roles remain unclear, PTBPH3 shows significant sequence similarity to other family members, all of which contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM of PRC, also termed PGC-1-related coactivator, one of the members of PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators family, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta. Unlike PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta, PRC is ubiquitous and more abundantly expressed in proliferating cells than in growth-arrested cells. PRC has been implicated in the regulation of several metabolic pathways, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cell growth. It functions as a growth-regulated transcriptional cofactor activating many nuclear genes specifying mitochondrial respiratory function. PRC directly interacts with nuclear transcriptional factors implicated in respiratory chain expression including nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2), CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). It interacts indirectly with the NRF-2beta subunit through host cell factor (HCF), a cellular protein involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, like PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta, PRC can transactivate a number of NRF-dependent nuclear genes required for mitochondrial respiratory function, including those encoding cytochrome c, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, Tfam, and TFB1M, and TFB2M. Further research indicates that PRC may also act as a sensor of metabolic stress that orchestrates a redox-sensitive program of inflammatory gene expression. PRC is a multi-domain protein containing an N-terminal activation domain, an LXXLL coactivator signature, a central proline-rich region, a tetrapeptide motif (DHDY) responsible for HCF binding, a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (SR) domain, and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).

SRSF10 is a serine-arginine (SR) protein that acts as a potent and general splicing repressor when dephosphorylated. It mediates global inhibition of splicing both in M phase of the cell cycle and in response to heat shock. SRSF10 emerges as a modulator of cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) splicing efficiency. It also regulates cardiac-specific alternative splicing of triadin pre-mRNA and is required for proper Ca2+ handling during embryonic heart development. In contrast, the phosphorylated SRSF10 functions as a sequence-specific splicing activator in the presence of a nuclear cofactor. It activates distal alternative 5' splice site of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA in vivo. Moreover, SRSF10 strengthens pre-mRNA recognition by U1 and U2 snRNPs.

PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. All members in this family contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	76	KH

NTC is composed of the scaffold protein Prp19 and a number of associated splicing factors, and plays a crucial role in intron removal during premature mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. Cwc2 functions as an RNA-binding protein that can bind both small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and pre-mRNA in vitro. It interacts directly with the U6 snRNA to link the NTC to the spliceosome during pre-mRNA splicing. In the N-terminal half, Cwc2 contains a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF domain), a RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and an intervening loop, also termed RNA-binding loop or RB loop, between ZnF and RRM, all of which are necessary and sufficient for RNA binding.

U1-70K plays an essential role in targeting the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site through protein-protein interactions with regulatory RNA-binding splicing factors, such as the RS protein ASF/SF2. Moreover, U1-70K protein can specifically bind to stem-loop I of the U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA) contained in the U1 snRNP complex. It also mediates the binding of U1C, another U1-specific protein, to the U1 snRNP complex. U1-70K contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), followed by an adjacent glycine-rich region at the N-terminal half, and two serine/arginine-rich (SR) domains at the C-terminal half. The RRM is responsible for the binding of stem-loop I of U1 snRNA molecule. Additionally, the most prominent immunodominant region that can be recognized by auto-antibodies from autoimmune patients may be located within the RRM. The SR domains are involved in protein-protein interaction with SR proteins that mediate 5' splice site recognition. For instance, the first SR domain is necessary and sufficient for ASF/SF2 Binding. The family also includes Drosophila U1-70K that is an essential splicing factor required for viability in flies, but its SR domain is dispensable.

The RNA-recognition motif of PrP8 is highly conserved and provides a possible RNA binding centre for the 5-prime SS, BP, or 3-prime SS of pre-mRNA which are known to contact with Prp8. The most conserved regions of an RRM are defined as the RNP1 and RNP2 sequences.

RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2), also termed Fox-1 homolog B, or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2 (HRNBP2), or RNA-binding motif protein 9 (RBM9), or repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity, is expressed in ovary, whole embryo, and human embryonic cell lines in addition to neurons and muscle. RBFOX2 activates splicing of neuron-specific exons through binding to downstream UGCAUG elements. RBFOX2 also functions as a repressor of tamoxifen activation of the estrogen receptor. RNA binding protein Fox-1 homolog 3 (RBFOX3 or NeuN or HRNBP3), also termed Fox-1 homolog C, is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing of the RBFOX2 pre-mRNA, producing a message encoding a dominant negative form of the RBFOX2 protein. Its message is detected exclusively in post-mitotic regions of embryonic brain. Like RBFOX1, both RBFOX2 and RBFOX3 bind to the hexanucleotide UGCAUG elements and modulate brain and muscle-specific splicing of exon EIIIB of fibronectin, exon N1 of c-src, and calcitonin/CGRP. Members in this family also harbor one RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains).	NA	76	RRM
241083	cd12639	RRM3_CELF3_4_5_6	RNA recognition motif 2 in CUGBP Elav-like family member CELF-3, CELF-4, CELF-5, CELF-6 and similar proteins. This subgroup corresponds to the RRM3 of CELF-3, CELF-4, CELF-5, and CELF-6, all of which belong to the CUGBP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) or BRUNOL (Bruno-like) family of RNA-binding proteins that display dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations and have been implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and in the control of mRNA translation and deadenylation. CELF-3, expressed in brain and testis only, is also known as bruno-like protein 1 (BRUNOL-1), or CAG repeat protein 4, or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 3, or embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-type RNA-binding protein 1 (ETR-1), or expanded repeat domain protein CAG/CTG 4, or trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 4 protein (TNRC4). It plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. CELF-3 contains three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBDs (RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains): two consecutive RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) situated in the N-terminal region followed by a linker region and the third RRM (RRM3) close to the C-terminus of the protein.The effect of CELF-3 on tau splicing is mediated mainly by the RNA-binding activity of RRM2. The divergent linker region might mediate the interaction of CELF-3 with other proteins regulating its activity or involved in target recognition. CELF-4, highly expressed throughout the brain and in glandular tissues, moderately expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, is also known as bruno-like protein 4 (BRUNOL-4), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 4. Like CELF-3, CELF-4 also contains three highly conserved RRMs. The splicing activation or repression activity of CELF-4 on some specific substrates is mediated by its RRM1/RRM2. Both, RRM1 and RRM2 of CELF-4, can activate cardiac troponin T (cTNT) exon 5 inclusion. CELF-5, expressed in brain, is also known as bruno-like protein 5 (BRUNOL-5), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 5. Although its biological role remains unclear, CELF-5 shares same domain architecture with CELF-3. CELF-6, strongly expressed in kidney, brain, and testis, is also known as bruno-like protein 6 (BRUNOL-6), or CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 6. It activates exon inclusion of a cardiac troponin T minigene in transient transfection assays in an muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE)-dependent manner and can activate inclusion via multiple copies of a single element, MSE2. CELF-6 also promotes skipping of exon 11 of insulin receptor, a known target of CELF activity that is expressed in kidney. In addition to three highly conserved RRMs, CELF-6 also possesses numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within the divergent linker region.

IPR002169	PF01752	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD

IPR004087	SM00322	K Homology domain	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. An evolutionarily conserved sequence of around 70 amino acids, the KH domain is present in a wide variety of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The KH domain binds RNA, and can function in RNA recognition. It is found in multiple copies in several proteins, where they can function cooperatively or independently. For example, in the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein KSRP, which has 4 KH domains, KH domains 3 and 4 behave as independent binding modules to interact with different regions of the AU-rich RNA targets. The solution structure of the first KH domain of FMR1 and of the C-terminal KH domain of hnRNP K determined by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) revealed a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure.

IPR018222	PS50177	Nuclear transport factor 2, eukaryote	 Ran is an evolutionary conserved member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that regulates all receptor-mediated transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Import receptors bind their cargos in the cytoplasm where the concentration of RanGTP is low and release their cargos in the nucleus where the concentration of RanGTP is high. Export receptors respond to Ran GTP in the opposite manner. Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a homodimer of approximately 14kDa subunits which stimulates efficient nuclear import of a cargo protein. NTF2 binds to both RanGDP and FxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. NTF2 binds to RanGDP sufficiently strongly for the complex to remain intact during transport through NPCs, but the interaction between NTF2 and FxFG nucleoporins is much more transient, which would enable NTF2 to move through the NPC by hopping from one repeat to another . NTF2 folds into a cone with a deep hydrophobic cavity, the opening of which is surrounded by several negatively charged residues. RanGDP binds to NTF2 by inserting a conserved phenylalanine residue into the hydrophobic pocket of NTF2 and making electrostatic interactions with the conserved negatively charged residues that surround the cavity.This entry contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The following proteins contain a region similar to NTF2: Eukaryotic NXF proteins. These are nuclear mRNA export factors. These proteins contain, in addition to a NTF2 domain, a number of leucine-rich repeats and a UBA domain. Eukaryotic NXT1/NXT2 proteins. These proteins are stimulators of protein export for NES-containing proteins. The also play a role in mRNA nuclear export. They heterodimerize with NFX proteins. In contrast to NTF2, NXT1 and NXT2 preferentially bind RanGTP. Eukaryotic Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-binding proteins (G3BP\s). These proteins contain one NTF2 domain and one RRM (see ).

Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans.

The repair of DNA containing O6-alkylated guanine is carried out by DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferase. The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction since the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and the methylated protein accumulates as a dead-end product.

IPR000504	SM00360	RNA recognition motif domain	 Many eukaryotic proteins containing one or more copies of a putative RNA-binding domain of about 90 amino acids are known to bind single-stranded RNAs . The largest group of single strand RNA-binding proteins is the eukaryotic RNA recognition motif (RRM) family that contains an eight amino acid RNP-1 consensus sequence . RRM proteins have a variety of RNA binding preferences and functions, and include heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing (SR, U2AF, Sxl), protein components of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 and U2 snRNPs), and proteins that regulate RNA stability and translation (PABP, La, Hu) . The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition. The motif also appears in a few single stranded DNA binding proteins.The typical RRM consists of four anti-parallel beta-strands and two alpha-helices arranged in a beta-alpha-beta-beta-alpha-beta fold with side chains that stack with RNA bases. Specificity of RNA binding is determined by multiple contacts with surrounding amino acids. A third helix is present during RNA binding in some cases. The RRM is reviewed in a number of publications .	IPB000504|PDOC00030|PF00076|PF16367|PS50102|SM00360	73	RRM

IPR023799	SSF89919	Ribosome-binding factor A domain	 Ribosomes are the particles that catalyse mRNA-directed protein synthesis in all organisms. The codons of the mRNA are exposed on the ribosome to allow tRNA binding. This leads to the incorporation of amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain in accordance with the genetic information. Incoming amino acid monomers enter the ribosomal A site in the form of aminoacyl-tRNAs complexed with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP. The growing polypeptide chain, situated in the P site as peptidyl-tRNA, is then transferred to aminoacyl-tRNA and the new peptidyl-tRNA, extended by one residue, is translocated to the P site with the aid the elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP as the deacylated tRNA is released from the ribosome through one or more exit sites . About 2/3 of the mass of the ribosome consists of RNA and 1/3 of protein. The proteins are named in accordance with the subunit of the ribosome which they belong to - the small (S1 to S31) and the large (L1 to L44). Usually they decorate the rRNA cores of the subunits. Many ribosomal proteins, particularly those of the large subunit, are composed of a globular, surfaced-exposed domain with long finger-like projections that extend into the rRNA core to stabilise its structure. Most of the proteins interact with multiple RNA elements, often from different domains. In the large subunit, about 1/3 of the 23S rRNA nucleotides are at least in van der Waal\s contact with protein, and L22 interacts with all six domains of the 23S rRNA. Proteins S4 and S7, which initiate assembly of the 16S rRNA, are located at junctions of five and four RNA helices, respectively. In this way proteins serve to organise and stabilise the rRNA tertiary structure. While the crucial activities of decoding and peptide transfer are RNA based, proteins play an active role in functions that may have evolved to streamline the process of protein synthesis. In addition to their function in the ribosome, many ribosomal proteins have some function \outside\ the ribosome .Ribosome-binding factor A (gene rbfA) is a bacterial protein thatassociates with free 30S ribosomal subunits. It does not associate with 30Ssubunits that are part of 70S ribosomes or polysomes. It is essential forefficient processing of 16S rRNA.Ribosome-binding factor A is a protein of from 13 to 15 Kd which is found inmost bacteria. A putative chloroplastic form seems to exist inplants.The structural domain of RbfA has an alpha-beta fold containing three helices and three beta-strands: alpha1-beta1-beta2-alpha2-alpha3-beta3. The structure has type-II KH-domain fold topology, related to conserved KH sequence family proteins whose betaalphaalphabeta subunits are characterised by a helix-turn-helix motif with sequence signature GxxG at the turn. In RbfA, this betaalphaalphabeta subunit is characterised by a helix-kink-helix motif in which the GxxG sequence is replaced by a conserved AxG sequence 	SSF89919	NA	KH

The foldpresents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, against which two alpha-helices pack from one side. This fold isrelated to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of thetranslational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster onthe same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acidrecognition.

IPR001606	SSF46774	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

IPR002169	PR00931	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD

Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analyses the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheets are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2.

RNA and DNA helicases are considered to beenzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in anenergy-dependent manner.The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with twoalpha-beta RecA-like domains . Thestructural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the fivecontiguous parallel beta strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds tothe amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and WalkerB (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.The carboxy-terminal alpha-beta domain is structurally very similar to theproximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting thatit may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below: DEAD-box RNA helicases. The prototype of DEAD-box proteins is the translation initiation factor eIF4A. The eIF4A protein is an RNA-dependent ATPase which functions together with eIF4B as an RNA helicase.DEAH-box RNA helicases.

It acts by opening DNA either around the RNA transcription start site or the DNA.Eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q. A DNA helicase that may play a role in the repair of DNA that is damaged by ultraviolet light or other mutagens.Bacterial and eukaryotic antiviral SKI2-like helicase.

It is generally found in association with other domains such as RRM and RS. The PWI domain is a RNA/DNA-binding domain that has an equal preference for single- and double-stranded nucleic acids and is likely to have multiple important functions in pre-mRNA processing.

The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family.

The RRM in heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) appears to have two RRM-like domains with specialised features for protein recognition.

The major mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in DNA is the formation of O6-alkylguanine. The alkyl group at the O-6 position is transferred to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction since the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and the methylated protein accumulates as a dead-end product. Most, but not all of the methyltransferases are also able to repair O-4-methylthymine. DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferases are widely distributed and are found in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.This group of proteins are characterised by having an N-terminal ribonuclease-like domain associated with 6-O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activity.	2.1.1.63|IPB008332|PF02870|SSF53155	77	DEAD

It interacts with the secY and secE components of the protein translocation system. It has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the transfer of proteins across the membrane.SecA is a superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that adapted to translocate proteins. It contains the characteristic DEAD/DEXH ATPase core structure with the seven SF2 motifs. Several structural analyses on secA have been reported . They show that secA contains two recA-like domains similar to SF1 and SF2 helicases. In helicases, the two recA-like domains move relative to one another during the ATPase cycle, generating domain movements that translocate the helicase along nucleic acids. In secA, it seems that a similar mechanism is used to generate domain movements that are coupled to polypeptide translocation. The N-terminal recA-like domain of secA contains an insert of about 150 residues that forms the preprotein crosslinking domain (PPXD) which has the ability to bind preproteins in solution and which is important for preprotein loading onto SecYEG-containing membranes.Homologs of secA are also encoded in the chloroplast genome of some algae as well as in the nuclear genome of plants.

IPR002169	IPB002169	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	296	DEAD

The first six beta-strands (1-6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel beta-sheet and face five alpha-helices on one side. The last two beta-strands form an antiparallel beta-sheet in the C terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal. Dimerisation of the molecule is crucial for function. The structure resembles that of some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L5. Although the structure resembles that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, the residues involved in RNA-binding in the L5 protein are not conserved in this family.

The protein has recently been shown to specifically bind to 16S rRNA and the 30S ribosomal subunit. Involvement of Era in protein synthesis is suggested by the fact that Era depletionresults in the translation defect both in vitro and in vivo. A Type 2 KH domain is found near the C terminus.

IPR008111	PR01738	RNA-binding motif protein 8	 RNA-binding motif protein 8 (RBM8) contains a putative RNA-binding domain known as an RNA recognition motif (RRM). The RRM motif is found in numerousRNA-binding proteins, including heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins(hnRNPs), and proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing. TheRRM is a 90-residue domain that binds single-stranded RNA; the structureconsists of four beta-stands and two alpha-helices arranged in an alpha/beta sandwich, with a third helix present in some cases during RNA binding.Three-dimensional modelling of the RBM8 RRM domain indicates that thesequences fold into an RNA-binding domain, forming a hydrophobic corebetween a beta-sheet and two helices.The human RBM8A protein is ubiquitously expressed; the protein is localisedpredominantly in the cell nucleus and diffused throughout the cytoplasm. It preferentially associates with mRNAs produced by splicing, includingboth nuclear mRNAs and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. Evidence suggeststhe protein remains associated with spliced mRNAs as a tag to indicate theposition of spliced introns. Human RBM8A protein specicially binds to MAGOH,the human homologue of Drosophila mago nashi, a protein required for normalgerm plasm development in the Drosophila embryo ; a similar associationoccurs with the Drosophila RBM8 protein, Tsunagi.The RBM8A and RBM8B protein sequences contain a putative bipartate nuclearlocalisation signal at the N terminus, as well a stretch of glycineresidues. In addition, the RRM contained within RBM8A and RBM8B contains one set of the two consensus nucleic acid-binding motifs, RNP-1 and RNP-2,characteristic of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP).

IPR019657	PF10719	Late competence development protein ComFB	 Competence is the ability of a cell to take up exogenous DNA from its environment, resulting in transformation. It is widespread among bacteria and is probably an important mechanism for the horizontal transfer of genes. DNA usually becomes available by the death and lysis of other cells. Competent bacteria use components of extracellular filaments called type 4 pili to create pores in their membranes and pull DNA through the pores into the cytoplasm. This process, including the development of competence and the expression of the uptake machinery, is regulated in response to cell-cell signalling and/or nutritional conditions.The development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis is a highly regulated adaptive response to stationary-phase stress. For competence to develop, the transcriptional regulator, ComK, must be activated. ComK is required for the expression of genes encoding proteins that function in DNA uptake. In log-phase cultures, ComK is inactive in a complex with MecA and ClpC. The comS gene is induced in response to high culture cell density and nutritional stress and its product functions to release active ComK from the complex. ComK then stimulates the transcription initiation of its own gene as well as that of the late competence operons.The comF locus has three open reading frames and is driven by a single sigma A-like promoter in front of comFORF1. It is dependent on early regulatory competence genes and is only expressed in competence medium. ComFORF1 is similar to an extensive family of ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases with closer similarity to the DEAD protein subfamily and to the PriA protein in Escherichia coli. ComFORF1 late gene product plays an essential role during the binding and uptake events involved in B. subtilis transformation. ComFB is the second protein encoded within the late competence locus ComF. The function of ComFB within late competence development is not known.	PF10719	NA	DEAD

IPR002169	3.4.24.3	Peptidase M9A/M9B, collagenase, bacterial	 Metalloproteases are the most diverse of the four main types of protease, with more than 50 families identified to date. In these enzymes, a divalent cation, usually zinc, activates the water molecule. The metal ion is held in place by amino acid ligands, usually three in number. The known metal ligands are His, Glu, Asp or Lys and at least one other residue is required for catalysis, which may play an electrophillic role. Of the known metalloproteases, around half contain an HEXXH motif, which has been shown in crystallographic studies to form part of the metal-binding site. The HEXXH motif is relatively common, but can be more stringently defined for metalloproteases as \abXHEbbHbc\, where \a\ is most often valine or threonine and forms part of the S1\ subsite in thermolysin and neprilysin, \b\ is an uncharged residue, and \c\ a hydrophobic residue. Proline is never found in this site, possibly because it would break the helical structure adopted by this motif in metalloproteases.This entry represents sequences belonging to peptidase family M9, subfamilies M9A and M9B (microbial collagenase, clan MA(E)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for members of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan MA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and thermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.Microbial collagenases have been identified from bacteria of both theVibrio and Clostridium genuses. Collagenase is used during bacterial attack to degrade the collagen barrier of the host during invasion. Vibrio bacteria are non-pathogenic, and are sometimes used in hospitals to remove dead tissue from burns and ulcers. Clostridium histolyticum is a pathogen that causes gas gangrene;nevertheless, the isolated collagenase has been used to treat bed sores.Collagen cleavage occurs at an Xaa+Gly in Vibrio bacteria and at Yaa+Glybonds in Clostridium collagenases.Analysis of the primary structure of the gene product from Clostridium perfringens has revealed that the enzyme is produced with a stretch of 86 residues that contain a putative signal sequence. Within this stretch is found PLGP, an amino acid sequence typical of collagenase substrates. This sequence may thus be implicated in self-processing of the collagenase.	3.4.24.3|IPB002169|PF01752|PR00931	192	DEAD

IPR001606	PF01388	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family. Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription. Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells. Mammalian RBP1 and RBP2, retinoblastoma binding factors.Mammalian Mrf-1 and Mrf-2, transcriptional modulators of the cytomegalovirus major intermediate-early promoter. Drosophila melanogaster Dead ringer protein, a transcriptional regulatory protein required for early embryonic development. Yeast SWI1 protein, from the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling and broad aspects of transcription regulation. Drosophila melanogaster Osa. It is structurally related to SWI1 and associates with the brahma complex, which is the Drosophila equivalent of the SWI/SNF complex.

It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2.

IPR002483	PS51025	PWI domain	 The PWI domain, named after a highly conserved PWI tri-peptide located within its N-terminal region, is a ~80 amino acid module, which is found either at the N terminus or at the C terminus of eukaryotic proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. It is generally found in association with other domains such as RRM and RS. The PWI domain is a RNA/DNA-binding domain that has an equal preference for single- and double-stranded nucleic acids and is likely to have multiple important functions in pre-mRNA processing. Proteins containing this domain include the SR-related nuclear matrix protein of 160kDa (SRm160) splicing and 3\-end cleavage-stimulatory factor, and the mammalian splicing factor PRP3.The PWI domain is a soluble, globular and independently folded domain which consists of a four-helix bundle, with structured N- and C-terminal elements.

IPR002521	PF01542	Hepatitis C virus core protein, C-terminal	 The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small (50 nm in size), enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus. It is the only known member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. There are six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus, which are identified numerically (e.g., genotype 1, genotype 2, etc.). Although Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus have similar names, because they all cause liver inflammation, these are distinctly different viruses both genetically and clinically.b"HCV has a positive sense RNA genome that consists of a single open reading frame of 9600 nucleotides. At the 5 and 3 ends of the RNA are the UTR regions that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5 UTR has a ribosome binding site (IRES - Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a 3000 amino acid containing protein that is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into 10 active structural and non-structural smaller proteins."The HCV core protein is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein and is followed by the signal sequence located between the core protein and the E1 envelope glycoprotein. This signal sequence targets the nascent HCV polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing the translocation of E1 to the ER lumen. Cleavage by a signal peptidase in the ER lumen releases the N-terminal end of E1, leaving the 191-amino acids (aa) core protein anchored by its C-terminal signal peptide . This 191aa polypeptide, also known as p23, is the immature form of the core protein; p23 is further processed by an intramembrane protease, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), that removes the ER anchor releasing p21, the N-terminal 179aa mature form of the core protein . Core protein (p21) is responsible for packaging viral RNA to form a viral nucleocapsid, and it also promotes virion budding. Two domains have been identified in the mature form of the HCV core protein, based on predicted structural and functional characteristics. Domain I, corresponding to the N-terminal region of approximately 120 aa, is a highly basic domain that is probably involved in the recruitment of viral RNA during particle morphogenesis. Domain II, located between aa 120 and aa 175, is a hydrophobic region predicted to form one or two alpha-helices that are probably involved in the association of core with the ER membrane and lipid droplets. This entry represents domain II and domain III (ER anchor sequence) of the core protein p23. 	PF01542	NA	DEAD

IPR001606	PS51011	ARID DNA-binding domain	 The AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) is an ~100-amino acid DNA-binding module found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cellproliferation, differentiation and development . The ARID domain appearsas a single-copy motif and can be found in association with other domains,such as JmjC, JmjN, Tudor and PHD-type zinc finger.The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of sixalpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structuredregion may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basicsix. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into threestructural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha- helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha- helix; Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha- helices at their N- and C-termini. Minimal ARIDs are distributed in all eukaryotes, while extended ARIDs arerestricted to metazoans. The ARID domain binds DNA as a monomer, recognizingthe duplex through insertion of a loop and an alpha-helix into the majorgroove, and by extensive non-specific anchoring contacts to the adjacentsugar-phosphate backbone .Some proteins known to contain a ARID domain are listed below: Eukaryotic transcription factors of the jumonji family. Mammalian Bright, a B-cell-specific trans-activator of IgH transcription. Mammalian PLU-1, a protein that is upregulated in breast cancer cells.

IPR005662	TIGR00436	GTP-binding protein Era	 Era is an essential G-protein in Escherichia coli identified originally as a homologue protein to Ras (E. coli Ras-like protein). It binds to GTP/GDP and contains a low intrinsic GTPase activity. Its function remains elusive, although it may be associated with cell division, energy metabolism, and cell-cycle check point. The protein has recently been shown to specifically bind to 16S rRNA and the 30S ribosomal subunit. Involvement of Era in protein synthesis is suggested by the fact that Era depletionresults in the translation defect both in vitro and in vivo. A Type 2 KH domain is found near the C terminus.

IPR004088	G3DSA:3.30.1370.10	K Homology domain, type 1	 The K homology (KH) domain was first identified in the human heterogeneousnuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K. It is a domain of around 70 amino acidsthat is present in a wide variety of quite diverse nucleic acid-bindingproteins. It has been shown to bind RNA . Like many other RNA-binding motifs, KH motifs are found in one or multiple copies (14 copies in chicken vigilin) and, at least for hnRNP K (three copies) and FMR-1 (two copies), each motif is necessary for in vitro RNA binding activity, suggesting that they may function cooperatively or, in the case of single KH motif proteins (for example, Mer1p), independently.According to structural analysis the KH domain can be separated in two groups. The first group or type-1 contain a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta-alpha structure, whereas in the type-2 the two last beta-sheet are located in the N-terminal part of the domain (alpha-beta-beta-alpha-alpha-beta). Sequence similarity between these two folds are limited to a short region (VIGXXGXXI) in the RNA binding motif. This motif is located between helice 1 and 2 in type-1 and between helice 2 and 3 in type-2. Proteins known to contain a type-1 KH domain include bacterial polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferases ; vertebrate fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1); eukaryotic heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), one of at least 20 major proteins that are part of hnRNP particles in mammalian cells; mammalian poly(rC) binding proteins; Artemia salina glycine-rich protein GRP33; yeast PAB1-binding protein 2 (PBP2); vertebrate vigilin; and human high-density lipoprotein binding protein (HDL-binding protein).

It has been proposed that the RWD domain might have a function in protein interaction. The RWD domain is predicted to have an alpha/beta secondary structure and isthought to be related to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCc) domain, althoughthe catalytic cysteine critical for ubiquitin-conjugating activity is notconserved in most members of the novel subfamily.

IPR001374	PS51061	R3H domain	 The R3H domain is a conserved sequence motif found in proteins from a diverserange of organisms including eubacteria, green plants, fungi and variousgroups of metazoans, but not in archaea and Escherichia coli. The R3H domaincontains an invariant arginine and a highly conserved histidine, that areseparated by three residues. It also displays a conserved pattern ofhydrophobic residues, prolines and glycines. It can be found alone, inassociation with AAA domain or with various DNA/RNA bindingdomains like DSRM, KH, G-patch, PHD, DEADbox, or RRM. The functions of thesedomains indicate that the R3H domain might be involved in polynucleotide-binding, including DNA, RNA and single-stranded DNA.The 3D structure of the R3H domain has been solved. The foldpresents a small motif, consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, against which two alpha-helices pack from one side. This fold isrelated to the structures of the YhhP protein and the C-terminal domain of thetranslational initiation factor IF3. Three conserved basic residues cluster onthe same face of the R3H domain and could play a role in nucleic acidrecognition. An extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecularsurface could act as a protein-binding site.	G3DSA:3.30.1370.50|IPB001374|PDOC51061|PF01424|PS51061|SM00393|SSF82708	79	RRM

IPR014013	PS51193	Helicase superfamily 1/2, ATP-binding domain, DinG/Rad3-type	 Helicases have been classified in 5 superfamilies (SF1-SF5). All of the proteins bind ATP and, consequently, all of them carry the classical Walker A(phosphate-binding loop or P-loop) and Walker B(Mg2+-binding aspartic acid) motifs. For the two largest groups, commonlyreferred to as SF1 and SF2, a total of seven characteristic motifs has beenidentified. These two superfamilies encompass a large number of DNA andRNA helicases from archaea, eubacteria, eukaryotes and viruses that seem to beactive as monomers or dimers. RNA and DNA helicases are considered to beenzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids in anenergy-dependent manner.The various structures of SF1 and SF2 helicases present a common core with twoalpha-beta RecA-like domains . Thestructural homology with the RecA recombination protein covers the fivecontiguous parallel beta strands and the tandem alpha helices. ATP binds tothe amino proximal alpha-beta domain, where the Walker A (motif I) and WalkerB (motif II) are found. The N-terminal domain also contains motif III (S-A-T)which was proposed to participate in linking ATPase and helicase activities.The carboxy-terminal alpha-beta domain is structurally very similar to theproximal one even though it is bereft of an ATP-binding site, suggesting thatit may have originally arisen through gene duplication of the first one.Some members of helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 are listed below: DEAD-box RNA helicases.
