Splicing factor 1 (SF1) specifically recognizes the intron branch point sequence (BPS) UACUAAC in the pre-mRNA transcripts during spliceosome assembly. We show that the KH-QUA2 region of SF1 defines an enlarged KH (hnRNP K) fold which is necessary and sufficient for BPS binding. KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA.

273892	TIGR01952	nusA_arch	NusA family KH domain protein, archaeal. This model represents a family of archaeal proteins found in a single copy per genome. It contains two KH domains (pfam00013) and is most closely related to the central region bacterial NusA, a transcription termination factor named for its iteraction with phage lambda protein N in E. coli. The proteins required for antitermination by N include NusA, NusB, nusE (ribosomal protein S10), and nusG. This system, on the whole, appears not to be present in the Archaea.

241146	cd12702	RRM4_PTBP2	RNA recognition motif 4 in vertebrate polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). This subgroup corresponds to the RRM4 of PTBP2, also known as neural polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or neurally-enriched homolog of PTB (nPTB), highly homologous to polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	80	KH

273893	TIGR01953	NusA	transcription termination factor NusA. This model describes NusA, or N utilization substance protein A, a bacterial transcription termination factor. It binds to RNA polymerase alpha subunit and promotes termination at certain RNA hairpin structures. It is named for the interaction in E. coli of phage lambda antitermination protein N with the N-utilization substance, consisting of NusA, NusB, NusE (ribosomal protein S10), and nusG. This model represents a region of NusA shared in all bacterial forms, and including an S1 (pfam00575) and a KH (pfam00013) RNA binding domains. Proteobacterial forms have an additional C-terminal region, not included in this model, with two repeats of 50-residue domain rich in acidic amino acids.

239089	cd02396	PCBP_like_KH	K homology RNA-binding domain, PCBP_like. Members of this group possess KH domains in a tandem arrangement. Most members, similar to the poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs) and Nova, containing three KH domains, with the first and second domains, which are represented here, in tandem arrangement, followed by a large spacer region, with the third domain near the C-terminal end of the protein. The poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs) can be divided into two groups, hnRNPs K/J and the alphaCPs, which share a triple KH domain configuration and poly(C) binding specificity. They play roles in mRNA stabilization, translational activation, and translational silencing. Nova-1 and Nova-2 are nuclear RNA-binding proteins that regulate splicing. This group also contains plant proteins that seem to have two tandem repeat arrrangements, like Hen4, a protein that plays a role in AGAMOUS (AG) pre-mRNA processing and important step in plant development.

It is found in a wide variety of proteins including ribosomal proteins, transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers of mRNA. There are two different KH domains that belong to different protein folds, but they share a single KH motif. The KH motif is folded into a beta alpha alpha beta unit. In addition to the core, type II KH domains (e.g. ribosomal protein S3) include N-terminal extension and type I KH domains (e.g. hnRNP K) contain C-terminal extension.	NA	64	KH

241137	cd12693	RRM2_PTBP1_like	RNA recognition motif 2 in polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I) and similar proteins. This subfamily corresponds to the RRM2 of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB or hnRNP I), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2 or nPTB), regulator of differentiation 1 (Rod1), and similar proteins found in Metazoa. PTB is an important negative regulator of alternative splicing in mammalian cells and also functions at several other aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA localization, stabilization, polyadenylation, and translation. PTBP2 is highly homologous to PTB and is perhaps specific to the vertebrates. Unlike PTB, PTBP2 is enriched in the brain and in some neural cell lines. It binds more stably to the downstream control sequence (DCS) RNA than PTB does but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. PTBP2 also greatly enhances the binding of two other proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP), to the DCS RNA. The binding properties of PTBP2 and its reduced inhibitory activity on splicing imply roles in controlling the assembly of other splicing-regulatory proteins. PTBP2 also contains four RRMs. ROD1 coding protein Rod1 is a mammalian PTB homolog of a regulator of differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the nrd1 gene encodes an RNA binding protein negatively regulates the onset of differentiation. ROD1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells or organs. It may play a role controlling differentiation in mammals. All members in this family contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRM), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain).	NA	96	KH
100064	cd02325	R3H	R3H domain. The name of the R3H domain comes from the characteristic spacing of the most conserved arginine and histidine residues. R3H domains are found in proteins together with ATPase domains, SF1 helicase domains, SF2 DEAH helicase domains, Cys-rich repeats, ring-type zinc fingers, and KH domains. The function of the domain is predicted to bind ssDNA or ssRNA in a sequence-specific manner.	NA	59	KH
