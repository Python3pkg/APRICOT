Although very similar in sequence, MDA5 recognizes different sets of viruses compared to RIG-I, a related RNA helicase. MDA5 associates with IPS-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. In general, CARDs are death domains (DDs) found associated with caspases. They are known to be important in the signaling pathways for apoptosis, inflammation, and host-defense mechanisms. DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures.

This subgroup corresponds to the RRM2 of DND1, also termed RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 4. It is an RNA-binding protein that is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates. It interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevents micro-RNA (miRNA) mediated repression of mRNA. For instance, DND1 binds cell cycle inhibitor, P27 (p27Kip1, CDKN1B), and cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, LATS2 (large tumor suppressor, homolog 2 of Drosophila). It helps maintain their protein expression through blocking the inhibitory function of microRNAs (miRNA) from these transcripts.

163687	cd08056	MPN_PRP8	Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domains without isopeptidase activity found in splicing factor Prp8. Members of this family are found in pre-mRNA-processing factor 8 (Prp8) which is a critical splicing factor, interacting with several other spliceosomal proteins, snRNAs, and the pre-mRNA, thus organizing and stabilizing the spliceosome catalytic core. Prp8 is one of the largest and most highly conserved of nuclear proteins, occupying a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome. Its C-terminal domain exhibits a JAB1/MPN-like core similar to deubiquitinating enzymes, but does not show catalytic isopeptidase activity, possibly because the putative isopeptidase center is covered by insertions and terminal appendices that are grafted onto this core, thus impairing the metal binding site. It is proposed that this domain is a protein interaction domain instead of a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme as proposed for some MPN proteins. The DEAD-box protein Brr2 and the GTPase Snu114 bind to the Prp8 C-terminus, a region where mutations in human Prp8 (hPrp8) cause a severe form of the genetic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, RP13, which leads to progressive photoreceptor degeneration in the retina and eventual blindness. At the N-terminus of Prp8, there are several domains, including a highly variable nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif rich in prolines, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM), and U5 and U6 snRNA binding sites.

It has been identified as a component of the spliceosome complex, as well as a component of the apobec-1 editosome, and has been implicated in the regulation of specific mRNA transport. ACF is an RNA-binding subunit of a core complex that interacts with apoB mRNA to facilitate C to U RNA editing. It may also act as an apoB mRNA recognition factor and chaperone, and play a key role in cell growth and differentiation. DND1 is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in vertebrates.

BfiI consists of two discrete domains with distinct functions: an N-terminal catalytic domain with non-specific nuclease activity and dimerization function that is more closely related to Nuc, an EDTA-resistant nuclease from the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, and a C-terminal domain that specifically recognizes its target sequences, 5'-ACTGGG-3'. BfiI forms a functionally active homodimer which has two DNA-binding surfaces located at the C-terminal domains but only one active site, located at the dimer interface between the two N-terminal catalytic domains that contain the two HKD motifs from both subunits. BfiI utilizes a single active site to cut both DNA strands, which represents a novel mechanism for the scission of double-stranded DNA. It uses a histidine residue from the HKD motif in one subunit as the nucleophile for the cleavage of the target phosphodiester bond in both of the anti-parallel DNA strands, while the symmetrically-related histidine residue from the HKD motif of the opposite subunit acts as the proton donor/acceptor during both strand-scission events.

260078	cd08819	CARD_MDA5_r2	Caspase activation and recruitment domain found in MDA5, second repeat. Caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) found in MDA5 (melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5), second repeat. MDA5, also known as IFIH1, contains two N-terminal CARD domains and a C-terminal RNA helicase domain. MDA5 is a cytoplasmic DEAD box RNA helicase that plays an important role in host antiviral response by sensing incoming viral RNA. Upon activation, the signal is transferred to downstream pathways via the adaptor molecule IPS-1 (MAVS, VISA, CARDIF), leading to the induction of type I interferons. Although very similar in sequence, MDA5 recognizes different sets of viruses compared to RIG-I, a related RNA helicase. MDA5 associates with IPS-1 through a CARD-CARD interaction. In general, CARDs are death domains (DDs) found associated with caspases. They are known to be important in the signaling pathways for apoptosis, inflammation, and host-defense mechanisms. DDs are protein-protein interaction domains found in a variety of domain architectures. Their common feature is that they form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by associating with other members of the DD superfamily including PYRIN and DED (Death Effector Domain). They serve as adaptors in signaling pathways and can recruit other proteins into signaling complexes.	NA	92	DEAD

The majority of dbpA proteins contain two N-terminal ATPase catalytic domains and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domain). The catalytic domains bind to nearby regions of RNA to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and disrupt RNA structures. The C-terminal domain is responsible for the high-affinity RNA binding. Several members of this family lack specificity for 23S rRNA. These proteins can generally be distinguished by a basic region that extends beyond the C-terminal domain.	NA	71	DEAD

This subfamily corresponds to the Gu C-terminal (GUCT) domain of RH-II/Gualpha and RH-II/Gubeta, two paralogues found in vertebrates. RH-II/Gualpha, also termed nucleolar RNA helicase 2, or DEAD box protein 21, or nucleolar RNA helicase Gu, is a bifunctional enzyme that displays independent RNA-unwinding and RNA-folding activities. It unwinds double-stranded RNA in the 5' to 3' direction in the presence of Mg2+ through the domains in its N-terminal region. In contrast, it folds single-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner and its C-terminal region is responsible for the Mg2+ independent RNA-foldase activity. RH-II/Gualpha consists of a DEAD box helicase domain (DEAD), a helicase conserved C-terminal domain (helicase_C), and a GUCT followed by three FRGQR repeats and one PRGQR sequence. The DEAD and helicase_C domains may play critical roles in the RNA-helicase activity of RH-II/Gualpha. The function of GUCT domain remains unclear. The C-terminal region responsible for the RNA-foldase activity does not overlap with the GUCT domain. RH-II/Gubeta, also termed ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX50, or DEAD box protein 50, or nucleolar protein Gu2, shows significant sequence homology with RH-II/Gualpha. It contains a DEAD domain, a helicase_C domain, and a GUCT domain followed by an arginine-serine-rich sequence but not (F/P)RGQR repeats in RH-II/Gualpha. Both RH-II/Gualpha and RH-II/Gubeta localize to nucleoli, suggesting roles in ribosomal RNA production, but RH-II/Gubeta also localizes to nuclear speckles containing the splicing factor SC35, suggesting its possible involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In contrast to RH-II/Gualpha, RH-II/Gubeta has RNA-unwinding activity, but no RNA-folding activity.	NA	93	DEAD

It binds to NXF1 and serves as receptor for the RNA export element RTE. It also possesses mRNA export activity and can facilitate the access of DEAD-box protein DBP5 to mRNA at the nuclear pore complex (NPC). RBM15 belongs to the Spen (split end) protein family, which contains three N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also known as RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), and a C-terminal SPOC (Spen paralogue and ortholog C-terminal) domain.

For instance, DND1 binds cell cycle inhibitor, P27 (p27Kip1, CDKN1B), and cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, LATS2 (large tumor suppressor, homolog 2 of Drosophila). It helps maintain their protein expression through blocking the inhibitory function of microRNAs (miRNA) from these transcripts. DND1 may also impose another level of translational regulation to modulate expression of critical factors in embryonic stem (ES) cells. DND1 interacts specifically with apolipoprotein B editing complex 3 (APOBEC3), a multi-functional protein inhibiting retroviral replication. The DND1-APOBEC3 interaction may play a role in maintaining viability of germ cells and for preventing germ cell tumor development.

All four SPSB proteins interact with c-Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, but only SPSB1, SPSB2, and SPSB4 interact with prostate apoptosis response protein 4 (Par-4). They are negative regulators that recruit the ECS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to polyubiquitinate inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), resulting in its proteasomal degradation, thus contributing to protection against the cytotoxic effect of iNOS in activated macrophages. It has been shown that SPSB1 and SPSB4 induce the degradation of iNOS more strongly than SPSB2. The Drosophila melanogaster SPSB1 homolog, GUSTAVUS, interacts with the DEAD box RNA helicase Vasa.
